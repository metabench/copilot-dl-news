# AGENTS Archives

This directory stores historical versions of `AGENTS.md` that were previously parked at the repository root. They remain available for reference but should not be edited directly. Current guidance lives in the root-level `AGENTS.md`; move any relevant lessons from these archives into the canonical doc instead of reviving the copies.

## Contents
- `AGENTS copy.md`
- `AGENTS_NEW.md`
