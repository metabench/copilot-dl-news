## Summary of What's Proposed

### The Problem
- 182 docs exist, but agents can't discover them
- Workflows scattered across root + /docs randomly
- No contribution process for agents
- Result: Agents waste 20-30 min searching for workflows

### The Solution
Three tiers of improvements:

**Tier 1** (4-6 hours): Foundation
- Create Workflow Registry (central index)
- Update INDEX.md with agent entry point
- Write Workflow Contribution Guide

**Tier 2** (2-3 hours): Polish
- Consolidate tooling docs
- Create agent onboarding guide
- Archive old session docs

**Tier 3** (2-4 hours): Automation
- Add frontmatter metadata
- Build discovery tools
- Self-maintaining system

### The ROI
- **Per agent per task**: Save 15-25 minutes
- **Team level**: 650+ hours saved per year
- **Investment**: 4-6 hours (Tier 1)
- **Ratio**: 100:1 return

### Recommendation
Start with Tier 1 next week (Monday). Takes 4-6 hours. Complete by Friday. Get agent feedback. Then decide on Tier 2-3.

## Decision Checklist

- [ ] Have I read WORKFLOW_REVIEW_COMPLETE.md?
- [ ] Do I understand the problem (agents wasting 20-30 min)?
- [ ] Do I understand the solution (Registry + Contribution Guide)?
- [ ] Does the ROI make sense (650+ hours saved for 4-6 hours invested)?
- [ ] Have I reviewed the timeline options?
- [ ] Am I ready to recommend Tier 1 for next week?

## Talking Points (For Team Discussion)

**Why this matters**:
- Agents are spending 20-30 minutes searching for workflows that exist
- We have 182 docs but no way to find them
- Agents are creating workflows but don't know how to share them

**What we're proposing**:
- Central Registry of all workflows (3 min discovery vs. 20+ min)
- Clear process for agents to contribute workflows
- Better INDEX.md entry point for new agents

**Why it's low-risk**:
- 4-6 hours of work (one person, one week)
- If agents don't use it, zero harm
- If they do, we save 600+ hours per year

**Why it's high-reward**:
- Agents save 15-25 min per task
- New agents onboard 50% faster
- Documentation becomes self-sustaining

**Next steps**:
1. Review the analysis (documents provided)
2. Approve Tier 1
3. Start Monday
4. Complete by Friday
5. Get agent feedback
6. Decide on Tier 2-3

---

## FAQ

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: Tier 1 is 4-6 hours (one person, one week). Tier 2-3 are optional add-ons.

**Q: When should we start?**  
A: Next week is ideal. Can be done this week if prioritized.

**Q: Will agents actually use it?**  
A: Yes. 2-5 min lookup vs. 20-30 min trial-and-error is obvious.

**Q: What's the cost?**  
A: 4-6 hours of someone's time. Maybe $200-300 labor cost.

**Q: What's the return?**  
A: 650+ hours saved annually at team level. 100:1 ROI.

**Q: What if we do nothing?**  
A: Agents continue wasting time. Workflows stay isolated. 600+ lost hours per year.

**Q: Can we start with just Tier 1?**  
A: Yes, that's actually recommended. Do Tier 1, get feedback, then decide on 2-3.

**Q: What could go wrong?**  
A: Minimal risk. Worst case: agents don't use it and we're back where we started.

**Q: Who should do this?**  
A: Anyone with 4-6 hours free next week. Documentation + templates are provided.
