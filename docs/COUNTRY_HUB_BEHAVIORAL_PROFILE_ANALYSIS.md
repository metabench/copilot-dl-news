# Country Hub Behavioral Profile Analysis & Enhancement Plan

**When to Read**: When working on country hub discovery logic; when analyzing crawler behavioral patterns; when implementing goal-driven crawling strategies.

## Executive Summary

The current intelligent crawler has robust technical infrastructure for country hub discovery and prioritization, but lacks a unified behavioral profile that defines goal-driven, state-aware crawling behavior. This analysis reveals that while individual components (GazetteerAwareReasonerPlugin, CountryHubGapService, priority bonuses) work well, they operate independently without coordinated behavioral objectives.

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ **Technical Infrastructure (Well-Defined)**

**GazetteerAwareReasonerPlugin**:
- Generates country hub URL predictions from gazetteer data
- Uses importance-based prioritization (35 bonus for discovery)
- Supports Total Prioritisation mode (100 priority)
- Integrates with CountryHubGapService for pattern learning

**CountryHubGapService**:
- Analyzes coverage gaps against gazetteer
- Learns URL patterns from successful discoveries
- Generates gap-driven predictions for missing countries
- Tracks completion milestones

**Priority System**:
- `country-hub-discovery`: 35 bonus (100 in Total Prioritisation)
- `country-hub-article`: 25 bonus (90 in Total Prioritisation)
- Queue ordering ensures country hubs processed first

**PageExecutionService**:
- Detects country hub pages via seeded hub metadata
- Applies article bonuses to links from country hubs
- Integrates gap analysis and pattern learning

### ❌ **Behavioral Profile Gaps (Poorly Defined)**

**No Explicit Behavioral Modes**:
- System has features but no named behavioral profiles
- No clear "Country Hub Focused" vs "Balanced Discovery" modes
- Configuration scattered across multiple files

**Limited Goal-Driven Behavior**:
- No explicit success/failure criteria for country hub collection
- No behavioral state tracking ("discovery phase", "gap-filling phase")
- No adaptive behavior based on progress

**Fragmented Behavioral Logic**:
- Country hub logic split across 4+ services
- No unified behavioral coordinator
- Telemetry scattered, no behavioral progress tracking

## Behavioral Profile Requirements

### Core Behavioral Objectives

**Country Hub Behavioral Profile** should define:

1. **Discovery Goal**: Systematically find all country hub pages for a domain
2. **Validation Goal**: Verify discovered hubs contain article links
3. **Indexing Goal**: Extract and prioritize article URLs from country hubs
4. **Completion Goal**: Achieve comprehensive geographic coverage

### Behavioral States

**Phase 1: Country Hub Discovery**
- Generate predictions from gazetteer
- Prioritize hub discovery over article collection
- Track discovery progress vs gazetteer coverage

**Phase 2: Hub Validation & Pattern Learning**
- Visit discovered hubs to validate functionality
- Learn successful URL patterns
- Update gap analysis with real coverage data

**Phase 3: Article Indexing**
- Extract article links from validated hubs
- Apply high priority to country-specific articles
- Track indexing coverage and quality

**Phase 4: Gap-Driven Completion**
- Identify remaining coverage gaps
- Generate targeted predictions for missing countries
- Adaptive prioritization based on gap analysis

### Success Criteria

**Behavioral Success Metrics**:
- **Coverage Target**: ≥80% of top 20 countries discovered
- **Validation Rate**: ≥90% of discovered hubs successfully visited
- **Article Yield**: Average 50+ articles per country hub
- **Completion Time**: All country hubs discovered within first 25% of crawl

## Recommended Behavioral Profile Implementation

### 1. CountryHubBehavioralProfile Class

```javascript
class CountryHubBehavioralProfile {
  constructor(config) {
    this.name = 'country-hub-focused';
    this.goals = {
      coverageTarget: 0.8,      // 80% of gazetteer countries
      validationRate: 0.9,      // 90% of discovered hubs visited
      articleYield: 50,         // Articles per hub
      completionTime: 0.25      // Within first 25% of crawl
    };
    this.state = {
      phase: 'discovery',       // discovery|validation|indexing|completion
      progress: {
        discovered: 0,
        validated: 0,
        indexed: 0,
        totalCountries: 0
      }
    };
  }

  // Behavioral decision methods
  shouldPrioritizeHubDiscovery() { /* ... */ }
  shouldEnterGapFillingMode() { /* ... */ }
  calculateAdaptivePriority(url, metadata) { /* ... */ }
  isBehavioralGoalMet() { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 2. Behavioral State Tracking

**State Management**:
- Track current behavioral phase
- Monitor progress against goals
- Adaptive priority adjustment
- Phase transition logic

**Progress Metrics**:
- Crawler state now exposes `getCountryHubProgress()` returning `discovered`, `validated`, and distinct `articleUrls`
- Countries discovered vs gazetteer total
- Hub validation success rate
- Article indexing volume
- Time-to-completion tracking

**Implementation (October 2025 update)**:
- `CrawlerState` seeds per-hub records when `kind: 'country'` metadata is present, adds visit metadata, and deduplicates indexed article URLs
- `PageExecutionService` forwards totals to `CountryHubBehavioralProfile.updateProgress()` whenever hub pages are processed, keeping behavioral goals in sync with live crawl state

### 3. Goal-Driven Priority System

**Dynamic Priority Calculation**:
```javascript
calculatePriority(url, metadata, behavioralState) {
  const basePriority = this.getBasePriority(url, metadata);

  // Apply behavioral modifiers
  if (behavioralState.phase === 'discovery') {
    return this.applyDiscoveryPriority(basePriority, metadata);
  }
  if (behavioralState.phase === 'gap-filling') {
    return this.applyGapFillingPriority(basePriority, metadata);
  }

  return basePriority;
}
```

### 4. Behavioral Mode Configuration

**Profile Selection**:
```json
{
  "behavioralProfile": "country-hub-focused",
  "profileConfig": {
    "coverageTarget": 0.8,
    "prioritizeValidation": true,
    "adaptiveGapFilling": true
  }
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Behavioral Profile Foundation
1. Create `CountryHubBehavioralProfile` class
2. Add behavioral state tracking to crawler
3. Implement basic goal monitoring

### Phase 2: Goal-Driven Prioritization
1. Integrate behavioral profile with priority system
2. Add adaptive priority calculation
3. Implement phase transition logic

### Phase 3: Behavioral Intelligence
1. Add success/failure criteria evaluation
2. Implement behavioral adaptation
3. Add comprehensive telemetry

### Phase 4: Profile Ecosystem
1. Create additional behavioral profiles (topic-focused, balanced)
2. Add profile selection UI
3. Implement profile switching

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Profile Coherence**: Single behavioral profile coordinates all country hub logic
- **State Awareness**: System tracks and reports behavioral state
- **Goal Achievement**: Clear success/failure criteria with progress tracking
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Priority adjustment based on behavioral goals

### User Experience Metrics
- **Predictable Behavior**: Users understand what behavioral mode crawler is in
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear reporting of behavioral goal progress
- **Configuration Clarity**: Easy selection and configuration of behavioral profiles
- **Reliable Outcomes**: Consistent achievement of behavioral objectives

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks
- **Complexity**: Behavioral profiles add coordination overhead
- **Performance**: State tracking and goal evaluation may impact speed
- **Maintenance**: Additional abstraction layer to maintain

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Implementation**: Add behavioral profiles without breaking existing functionality
- **Performance Monitoring**: Benchmark behavioral overhead
- **Fallback Behavior**: Graceful degradation if behavioral system fails

## Conclusion

The current country hub prioritization system has excellent technical components but lacks behavioral coherence. Implementing a unified behavioral profile will transform scattered prioritization logic into a goal-driven, state-aware crawling behavior that users can understand and configure.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 implementation to establish behavioral profile foundation, then incrementally add goal-driven features. This will create a more intelligent, user-friendly crawling system with clear behavioral objectives and predictable outcomes.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create `CountryHubBehavioralProfile` class skeleton
2. **Short-term**: Integrate basic behavioral state tracking
3. **Medium-term**: Implement goal-driven priority system
4. **Long-term**: Add behavioral intelligence and adaptation
