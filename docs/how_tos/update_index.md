# How-To: Update the Documentation Index

1. Open `docs/INDEX.md` and locate the relevant section (Agents, Workflows, Standards, How-tos, Reference, Checklists).
2. Insert new entries in alphabetical order within the section.
3. Use relative links (e.g., `agents/agent_policy.md`).
4. Update the `_Last updated_` timestamp at the top of the file.
5. Run the link integrity check and append results to [../reports/link_check.md](../reports/link_check.md).
