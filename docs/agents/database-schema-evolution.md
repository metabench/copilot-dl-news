## Summary
Comprehensive database normalization and compression infrastructure plan enabling schema evolution without breaking changes. Includes migration-free normalization, dual-write compatibility, and 70-85% size reduction through compression. Ready for incremental implementation with zero downtime.

## When to use
- When planning database schema changes or normalization
- When implementing compression infrastructure
- When needing to evolve schema without export/import cycles
- When adding new normalized tables alongside existing schema
- When planning migration strategies with backward compatibility

## Procedure
1. **Review full plan**: Read `docs/DATABASE_NORMALIZATION_PLAN.md` (80+ pages) for technical specification
2. **Start with Phase 0**: Implement migration infrastructure (`docs/PHASE_0_IMPLEMENTATION.md`) - zero risk, 1-2 days
3. **Add compression**: Implement gzip/brotli infrastructure (`docs/COMPRESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_FULL.md`) - 2-4 hours
4. **Add normalized tables**: Create new tables alongside existing schema without breaking changes
5. **Implement dual-write**: Write to both old and new schemas during transition
6. **Create views**: Add backward compatibility views for zero-downtime migration
7. **Gradual cutover**: Switch reads to views, then normalized tables
8. **Validate and cleanup**: Archive legacy tables after validation period

## Gotchas
- **No breaking changes**: Always maintain backward compatibility during transition
- **Dual-write overhead**: Temporary performance impact during migration period
- **View complexity**: Ensure views accurately reconstruct denormalized tables
- **Compression trade-offs**: Higher compression ratios = slower access times
- **Schema versioning**: Track schema versions for migration management
- **Testing required**: Extensive testing needed for dual-write and view accuracy
