## Summary
Quick database inspection tools that eliminate PowerShell approval dialogs by using simple Node commands. Includes table structure, indexes, foreign keys, stats, and read-only queries. Tools open database read-only for safety and format output for readability. Eliminates need for complex PowerShell commands that trigger security prompts.

## When to use
- When needing database structure information (tables, columns, indexes)
- For read-only queries during development and debugging
- To verify schema after code changes
- When checking foreign key relationships or row counts

## Procedure
1. Use `node tools/db-schema.js tables` to list all tables
2. Use `node tools/db-schema.js table <name>` for column details
3. Use `node tools/db-schema.js indexes <name>` for index information
4. Use `node tools/db-schema.js stats` for row counts and DB size
5. Use `node tools/db-query.js "SELECT * FROM <table> LIMIT 5"` for queries
6. Use `--json` flag for JSON-formatted output when needed

## Gotchas
- Tools open database read-only for safety
- Simple Node commands don't trigger approval dialogs
- VS Code auto-approve setting affects complex PowerShell commands
- Commands requiring piping or complex operations will trigger approval
- Always use read-only operations for inspection
