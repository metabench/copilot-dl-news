# js-tools Agent State

- Focus: Ship and validate the refreshed `js-scan --deps-of` experience, including parse error summarisation that keeps dependency tables prominent (2025-11-07).
- Constraints: Follow Upgrade js-md-scan-edit mode directives; update PLAN/LOG/MODEL docs alongside any code changes.
- Next Milestone: Gather agent feedback on `--deps-of` summaries and outline follow-up refinements (depth UI, guidance tweaks) before the next iteration.
- Feedback: Parse warnings now summarised with a `--deps-parse-errors` hint; monitor bilingual output and decide whether counts should surface earlier in the tables.
- Backlog: Depth UI mock + guidance phrasing draft (acceptance = documented options + effort estimate ready for next plan).
