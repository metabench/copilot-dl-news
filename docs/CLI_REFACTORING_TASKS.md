# CLI Refactoring Tasks — Autonomous Execution Plan

**Date Created:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 6 Complete → All Tasks Complete  
**Mode:** Continuous autonomous execution with progress tracking

---

## Overview

This document tracks all remaining CLI tool refactoring tasks. Tasks are executed autonomously with progress updates recorded in real-time. The refactoring applies the established CliFormatter + CliArgumentParser pattern to all CLI tools systematically.

**Working Pattern:**
1. Select next task from task list
2. Mark as IN_PROGRESS
3. Execute refactoring
4. Validate output
5. Mark as COMPLETE
6. Move to next task

No human approval needed between tasks. This is continuous autonomous work until all tasks are complete or blockers are encountered.

## Task Inventory

### Phase 7: URL Normalization Cleanup (New Scope)

Tasks to finish retiring legacy TEXT URL columns now that all `article_places` rows carry `article_url_id` references.

| # | Task | Scope | Status | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| 7.1 | Stabilize tooling for column removal | Update normalization/validation scripts to treat `article_url` as optional, refresh docs, plan safe drop workflow | ✅ COMPLETED | HIGH | 2025-10-31: Scripts now short-circuit when the column is absent, index creation is idempotent, and docs updated with post-drop guidance |
| 7.2 | Remove runtime dependencies on TEXT column | Update any code paths that still join on `article_places.article_url` (deprecated UI queries/tests) to use `article_url_id` + `urls` join, adjust indexes, and add smoke coverage | in-progress | HIGH | 2025-10-31: Deprecated UI data module now defers to adapter helpers; focused Jest (`gazetteerPlace.data.test.js`) updated to run against schemas without `articles`/`article_places` tables. Remaining work: audit other `articles` references (API endpoints, background tasks) and move residual SQL behind adapters before column drop. |
| 7.3 | Drop `article_url` column safely | Enhance migration tooling to recreate table without the column, rebuild indexes on `article_url_id`, run drop in `--fix` mode, and validate via CLI | not-started | HIGH | Requires completion of Tasks 7.1 and 7.2 |

- **Active phase:** Phase 7 — URL Normalization Cleanup
- **Current sub-phase:** γ — Implementation & validation (entered 2025-10-31)
- **Docs consulted this session:** `docs/DATABASE_URL_NORMALIZATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/CHANGE_PLAN.md`

### Phase 2: Completed ✅
- ✅ Create CliFormatter module
- ✅ Create CliArgumentParser wrapper
- ✅ Install commander.js
- ✅ Refactor validate-gazetteer.js
- ✅ Refactor analyze-domains.js
- ✅ Refactor detect-articles.js
- ✅ Document patterns and examples

**Result:** 3 pilot tools with beautiful output. Pattern established and proven.

### Phase 3: HubValidator Modularization (New Scope)

Tasks for breaking down the monolithic HubValidator class into focused modules while maintaining backward compatibility.

| # | Task | Scope | Status | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| 2.1 | Create HubNormalizer module | Extract URL normalization, HTML processing, and utility functions | ✅ COMPLETED | HIGH | Created `src/hub-validation/HubNormalizer.js` (80+ lines) |
| 2.2 | Create HubCacheManager module | Extract article caching and retrieval logic | ✅ COMPLETED | HIGH | Created `src/hub-validation/HubCacheManager.js` (70+ lines) |
| 2.3 | Create HubUrlValidator module | Extract URL structure validation for different hub types | ✅ COMPLETED | HIGH | Created `src/hub-validation/HubUrlValidator.js` (100+ lines) |
| 2.4 | Create HubContentAnalyzer module | Extract content analysis and validation metrics building | ✅ COMPLETED | HIGH | Created `src/hub-validation/HubContentAnalyzer.js` (70+ lines) |
| 2.5 | Create HubValidationEngine module | Extract core validation logic for all hub types | ✅ COMPLETED | HIGH | Created `src/hub-validation/HubValidationEngine.js` (400+ lines) |
| 2.6 | Refactor HubValidator as facade | Update HubValidator.js to delegate to specialized modules | ✅ COMPLETED | HIGH | Reduced from 967 to ~200 lines, maintains full backward compatibility |

**Result:** HubValidator broken down from 967 lines into 6 focused modules (5 specialized + 1 facade). All validation functionality preserved with improved maintainability and testability.

## Execution Strategy

### Per-Task Workflow

**BEFORE STARTING:**
1. Read task file (max 150 lines to start)
2. Identify current output format
3. Determine needed refactoring scope
4. Scan for inline SQL (look for `raw.prepare`, `db.prepare`, `db.exec`, raw `SELECT`/`INSERT` strings). Move any statements you find into the appropriate adapter under `src/db/sqlite/v1/queries/` before proceeding.
5. Check if it's already using CliFormatter (skip if yes)

**DURING EXECUTION:**
1. Create backup notes of original structure
2. Add CliFormatter + CliArgumentParser imports
3. Replace argument parsing with CliArgumentParser
4. Replace console.log/process.stdout with fmt.* calls
5. Test with sample data or --help flag

**AFTER EXECUTION:**
1. Mark task as COMPLETE
2. Record changes made
3. Note any special cases
4. Move to next task

### Batch Processing

Work in batches of 5 tasks per phase:
- Phase 3A: Tasks 3.1-3.5 (Tier 1 core tools)
- Phase 3B: Tasks 3.6-3.10 (Tier 2 analysis tools)
- Phase 3C: Tasks 3.11-3.15 (Tier 3 specialized tools)
- Phase 3D: Tasks 3.16-3.20 (Tier 4 infrastructure review)

After each batch, update this document with completion status.

---

### ⏳ IN_PROGRESS: Phase 3A Tier 1 Tools

#### 3.1 find-place-hubs.js ✅
- **File:** `src/tools/find-place-hubs.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Summary:** Migrated to CliArgumentParser + CliFormatter and added schema-aware fallbacks so legacy SQLite snapshots without `host`, `section`, `analysis`, or `word_count` columns still run safely.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Replaced bespoke argument parser with CliArgumentParser (handles `--apply`, `--no-list`, help output).
   - Rebuilt console output with CliFormatter (header, stats, tables, footer).
   - Added dynamic PRAGMA column detection and URL host derivation to avoid `no such column` failures.
- **Validation:**
   - `node src/tools/find-place-hubs.js --help`
   - `node src/tools/find-place-hubs.js --limit 5`
- **Metrics:** ~90 lines touched (net +12) with duplicated parsing logic removed and robust fallbacks added.

#### 3.2 guess-place-hubs.js ✅
- **File:** `src/tools/guess-place-hubs.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Summary:** Refactored hub guessing CLI to use CliArgumentParser + CliFormatter with optional JSON output while buffering logs for clean machine-readable mode.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Replaced bespoke parser with CliArgumentParser (positional domains, `--json`, shared numeric flags) and updated the shared parser to allow excess arguments safely.
   - Added CliFormatter-driven sections for configuration, results, recent decisions, and optional verbose logs.
   - Introduced formatting helpers and logger buffering so verbose streams render nicely without contaminating JSON output.
- **Validation:**
   - `node src/tools/guess-place-hubs.js --help`
   - `node src/tools/guess-place-hubs.js example.com --limit 0 --json` (verifies JSON path + positional domain handling; halts when DB preconditions missing)
   - `node src/tools/find-place-hubs.js example.com --limit 1 --json` (regression check for shared parser positional support)

#### 3.3 export-gazetteer.js ✅
- **File:** `src/tools/export-gazetteer.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Summary:** Migrated gazetteer export tool to CliArgumentParser + CliFormatter, added JSON summary mode, and surfaced per-table counts while preserving NDJSON stream semantics.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Replaced bespoke argument parsing with standardized options (`--db`, `--out`, `--format`, `--quiet`).
   - Introduced structured summary output (ASCII or JSON) including record counts, duration, and file size; `--quiet` suppresses it.
   - Counted rows during export and retained `scrubExtra` logic; fallback still ensures database if read-only open fails.
- **Validation:**
   - `node src/tools/export-gazetteer.js --out tmp/test-gazetteer.ndjson --format json`

#### 3.4 populate-gazetteer.js ✅
- **File:** `src/tools/populate-gazetteer.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Scope:** Data import/population
- **Summary:** Completed end-to-end refactor with CliFormatter + CliArgumentParser, moved all SQL through the v1 populate query module, and upgraded verbose diagnostics to formatter-driven tables while preserving logger fallbacks for quiet mode.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Routed REST Countries and Wikidata insert/update flows through `createPopulateGazetteerQueries`, replacing inline SQL for names, hierarchy, ADM codes, and cleanup.
   - Added formatter-powered snapshot and delta tables (with quiet-mode fallbacks) to replace manual tab-delimited logging.
   - Ensured helper usage for hierarchy links, canonical selection, external IDs, and cleanup routines to keep adapters the single touchpoint.
- **Validation:**
   - `node src/tools/populate-gazetteer.js --help`
   - `node src/tools/populate-gazetteer.js --db tmp/populate-cli.db --offline --countries=GB --force --summary-format ascii`

#### 3.5 backfill-dates.js ✅
- **File:** `src/tools/backfill-dates.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Summary:** Modernized the backfill utility with CliArgumentParser + CliFormatter, routed every query through a new `createBackfillDatesQueries` adapter, and added structured summaries while preserving the legacy tab-delimited event stream for pipelines.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Replaced ad-hoc argument parsing with standardized flags (`--stream`, `--summary-format`, `--no-list-existing`) and configuration display.
   - Added `articles.backfillDates` query helper for batch selection, existing-date iteration, and updates; CLI now uses adapter instead of inline SQL.
   - Introduced ASCII/JSON summary output (with `--quiet` for JSON-only) plus event counter tracking.
- **Validation:**
   - `node src/tools/backfill-dates.js --help`

### ✅ COMPLETE: Phase 3B Tier 2 Tools (Partial)

#### 3.6 show-analysis.js ✅
- **File:** `src/tools/show-analysis.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Summary:** Migrated the analysis viewer to CliArgumentParser + CliFormatter, added JSON output, and routed SQL through `createShowAnalysisQueries` so the CLI no longer owns inline queries.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Swapped bespoke argument parsing for standardized options (`--db`, `--url`, `--verbose`, `--full-json`, `--json`).
   - Introduced formatter-driven sections for system status, HTTP metadata, storage metrics, and findings (including table previews).
   - Added JSON summary mode for automation and moved SQL lookups into `analysis.showAnalysis` adapter with robust error handling.
- **Validation:**
   - `node src/tools/show-analysis.js --help`
   - `node src/tools/show-analysis.js --url https://example.com --json`

### ⏳ NOT_STARTED: Remaining Phase 3B Tier 2 Tools

#### 3.7 analyse-pages-core.js ✅
- **File:** `src/tools/analyse-pages-core.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Summary:** Centralized every SQL statement behind `createAnalysePagesCoreQueries`, rewired the analysis loop to consume adapter helpers, and ensured decompression + hub persistence operate without touching raw statements. Added optional compression-bucket support detection with single warning emission and kept telemetry hooks intact.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Added `analysis.analysePagesCore` adapter exposing pending-analysis selection, bucket lookups, analysis updates, hub writes, and unknown-term persistence with shared connection handling.
   - Refactored the CLI worker to obtain queries once, wire helper functions (`loadHtmlForRow`, hub save paths) through the adapter, and streamline optional features (compression buckets, unknown-term capturing).
   - Tidied error handling so missing compression schema downgrades gracefully while preserving verbose logging.
- **Validation:**
   - `node -e "require('./src/tools/analyse-pages-core.js'); console.log('analyse-pages-core loaded')"`
   - `npx jest --runTestsByPath src/tools/__tests__/analyse-pages-core.hubs.test.js --bail=1 --maxWorkers=50%` *(blocked by jsdom/parse5 ESM import; noted for follow-up)*

#### 3.8 crawl-place-hubs.js ✅
- **File:** `tools/crawl-place-hubs.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Refactor Plan:**
   1. Swap bespoke chalk logging + manual argv parsing for `CliFormatter` + `CliArgumentParser`, keeping lively runtime messaging while aligning configuration/summaries with the shared pattern.
   2. Extract place hub selection queries into `createCrawlPlaceHubsQueries` under `src/db/sqlite/v1/queries/`, removing inline SQL from the CLI.
   3. Enforce `--max-pages` as a positive integer with updated help/summary messaging so max limits actually cut off long crawls and default to "unlimited" only when omitted.
   4. Emit structured configuration and completion summaries (ASCII and JSON modes) and ensure crawler overrides pipe through formatter-aware logs without regressing existing behavior.
- **Summary:** CLI now enforces positive `--max-pages`, surfaces clearer help/summary text, and preserves quiet/JSON automation flows while leaving runtime progress streams intact. Queries remain routed through the existing adapter, and new validation guardrails prevent unlimited crawls by mistake.
- **Validation:**
   - `node tools/crawl-place-hubs.js --max-pages 0 --depth 0 --summary-format ascii`
   - `node tools/crawl-place-hubs.js --max-pages 1 --summary-format json --quiet`

#### 3.9 count-testlogs.js ✅
- **File:** `tools/count-testlogs.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Summary:** Migrated the test log counter to CliArgumentParser + CliFormatter, providing structured ASCII output by default and JSON summaries for automation while retaining simple flags for breakdown and verbose listings.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Standardized CLI options (`--path`, `--breakdown`, `--verbose`, `--summary-format`, `--quiet`) and added graceful EPIPE handling for shell pipelines.
   - Produced formatter-driven sections for totals, recent files, optional suite breakdowns, and verbose listings, including humanized byte sizes and ISO timestamps.
   - Added JSON payloads mirroring the ASCII report, enhanced missing-directory feedback, and normalized filename parsing for suite detection.
- **Validation:**
   - `node tools/count-testlogs.js --help`
   - `node tools/count-testlogs.js --breakdown`
   - `node tools/count-testlogs.js --summary-format json --quiet`

#### 3.10 db-schema.js ✅
- **File:** `tools/db-schema.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Refactor Plan:**
   1. Replace bespoke argv parsing with `CliArgumentParser`, exposing `--db`, `--summary-format`, `--quiet`, and capturing positional subcommands (`tables`, `table`, `indexes`, `foreign-keys`, `stats`).
   2. Introduce formatter-driven rendering for each subcommand (tables, table detail, indexes, foreign keys, stats) plus JSON payload mirroring results; add helpful metadata like database path and table counts.
   3. Harden error handling (missing command, unknown table/index, absent database path) and remove progress `stderr` writes in favor of clear formatter messaging.
- **Summary:** CLI now standardizes parsing/output, adds ASCII sections for every subcommand, and provides clean JSON payloads (pretty or quiet) while guarding for missing databases, unknown tables, and EPIPE conditions. Rendering logic maps raw schema metadata into formatter tables and ensures row counts include error context when queries fail.
- **Validation:**
   - `node tools/db-schema.js tables`
   - `node tools/db-schema.js table articles`
   - `node tools/db-schema.js indexes articles`
   - `node tools/db-schema.js stats --summary-format json`
   - `node tools/db-schema.js stats --quiet`
   - `node tools/db-schema.js tables --db data\missing.db`

### 🚧 IN_PROGRESS: Phase 3C Tier 3 Tools (Partial)

#### 3.11 get-test-summary.js ✅
- **File:** `tests/get-test-summary.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Summary:** CLI now uses `CliArgumentParser` + `CliFormatter`, delivers consistent ASCII sections for summary/resolved/failing blocks, supports compact one-liners, and emits clean JSON (pretty or quiet) without shell noise. Positional suite filters coexist with `--suite`, fallback detection stays intact, and exit codes still mirror failure counts.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Introduced standardized parsing (`--suite`, `--summary-format`, `--quiet`, `--json`, `--compact`) with validation that quiet mode only applies to JSON.
   - Replaced manual console output with formatter-driven headers, stats, lists, and info/warn notes for suspect ALL suites, fallback logs, and broken-suite counts.
   - Added JSON/quiet emitters plus compact formatter preserving previous telemetry fields while avoiding duplicate message spam.
- **Validation:**
   - `node tests/get-test-summary.js`
   - `node tests/get-test-summary.js --json`
   - `node tests/get-test-summary.js --summary-format json --quiet`

#### 3.12 get-failing-tests.js ✅
- **File:** `tests/get-failing-tests.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** LOW
- **Summary:** Rebuilt the failing-test reporter on top of `CliArgumentParser` + `CliFormatter`, added structured ASCII and JSON emitters for latest summaries and history snapshots, and enforced quiet-mode JSON to keep automation output clean. Normalized positional suite filters, surfaced history metadata (attempt counts, runtimes, exit codes), and tightened error paths when no failures or logs exist.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Introduced `createParser` + `normalizeOptions` helpers to handle positional suite filters, `--history`, `--logs`, `--simple`, `--count`, and JSON/quiet aliases with guardrails against invalid flag combinations.
   - Added builder/render pairs (`buildLatestReport`, `renderLatestAscii`, `emitLatestJson`, `buildHistoryReport`, etc.) so ASCII tables and JSON payloads share the same enriched record structures, including runtime, attempts, and stored failure message excerpts.
   - Ensured quiet mode requires JSON, emits machine-readable payloads only, and corrected process exit handling (no stray `process.EXITCODE`).
- **Validation:**
   - `node tests/get-failing-tests.js`
   - `node tests/get-failing-tests.js --history`
   - `node tests/get-failing-tests.js --summary-format json --quiet`
   - `node tests/get-failing-tests.js --json --quiet`
   - `node tests/get-failing-tests.js --count`
   - `node tests/get-failing-tests.js --count --json`
   - `node tests/get-failing-tests.js --simple --json`
   - `node tests/get-failing-tests.js --quiet` *(expected error path)*
   - `node tests/get-failing-tests.js --history --json --quiet`

#### 3.13 get-latest-log.js ✅
- **File:** `tests/get-latest-log.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** LOW
- **Summary:** Upgraded the log locator to `CliArgumentParser` + `CliFormatter`, added ASCII/JSON summaries with suite filter context, and enforced quiet-mode JSON so automation pipelines receive machine-readable output only. Sorting now relies on filesystem mtimes with suite fallbacks for legacy filenames.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Introduced parser normalization for positional suite filters plus `--json`, `--summary-format`, and quiet guardrails (quiet ⇒ JSON).
   - Added metadata collectors for suite, timestamp hints, and file stats, rendering structured ASCII sections (header, summary, path) and mirroring payloads in JSON with human-readable byte sizes.
   - Hardened error handling for missing directories and absent suite matches, reusing `CliError` exit codes and EPIPE handling consistent with other tools.
- **Validation:**
   - `node tests/get-latest-log.js`
   - `node tests/get-latest-log.js unit`
   - `node tests/get-latest-log.js --summary-format json --quiet`
   - `node tests/get-latest-log.js --json --quiet`
   - `node tests/get-latest-log.js unit --json`

#### 3.14 get-slow-tests.js ✅
- **File:** `tests/get-slow-tests.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** LOW
- **Summary:** Modernized the slow-test reporter with `CliArgumentParser` + `CliFormatter`, added JSON/quiet support, and reused `get-latest-log` helpers to avoid spawning subprocesses. The CLI now surfaces structured summaries, color-coded tables, and machine-readable payloads while guarding for missing log sections and invalid thresholds.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Normalized argument parsing (positional threshold + suite, `--count`, `--summary-format`, `--json`, `--quiet`) with validation that quiet mode only targets JSON and thresholds remain positive.
   - Replaced manual logging with formatter-driven header/summary/table output, including runtime highlighting and failure emphasis; JSON payload mirrors stats, notes, and per-test details.
   - Imported `findLatestLogEntry`/`buildLatestLogJson` from `get-latest-log.js` (now exportable) to locate logs synchronously, eliminating `execSync` usage and adding clear error messaging for missing directories/logs.
- **Validation:**
   - `node tests/get-slow-tests.js`
   - `node tests/get-slow-tests.js 3 unit`
   - `node tests/get-slow-tests.js --count`
   - `node tests/get-slow-tests.js --summary-format json --quiet`
   - `node tests/get-slow-tests.js --count --summary-format json`

#### 3.15 intelligent-crawl.js ✅
- **File:** `tools/intelligent-crawl.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** LOW
- **Summary:** Standardized the intelligent crawl CLI around `CliArgumentParser` and `CliFormatter`, added structured crawl/verification summaries, and introduced quiet-mode JSON reporting with captured progress logs.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Replaced bespoke argument parsing with a parser-driven declaration that covers limits, filters, verification toggles, and summary-format/quiet combinations with upfront validation.
   - Rebuilt reporting via `CliFormatter` for both verification and crawl runs, emitting consistent headers, sections, tables, and machine-readable payloads while preserving prior ASCII output.
   - Added log interception so quiet JSON mode returns structured results alongside captured progress, and promoted crawler config/coverage metadata into formatter summaries.
- **Validation:**
   - `node tools/intelligent-crawl.js --help`
   - `node tools/intelligent-crawl.js --quick-verification --summary-format json --quiet`
   - `node tools/intelligent-crawl.js --quick-verification`

### ⏳ PENDING_REVIEW: Phase 3D Tier 4 Tools

#### 3.16 analysis-run.js ✅
- **File:** `src/tools/analysis-run.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** LOW
- **Summary:** Modernized the analysis runner CLI to use `CliArgumentParser` + `CliFormatter`, added explicit `--no-progress-logging`, and surfaced a structured completion summary without disrupting legacy `[analysis-run]` streaming logs or programmatic `runAnalysis` usage.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Introduced a shared parser factory that maps all legacy flags (db/limits/skip/dry-run/benchmark/piechart/run-id) and defaults the news.db path via `findProjectRoot`.
   - Added formatter-driven summary output (header, configuration stats, stage table, highlights) that appears after runs while preserving raw progress lines for existing tests and tooling.
   - Hardened CLI error handling to emit formatted errors, retained exported `parseArgs`, and wired `--no-progress-logging` through to the existing progress sink logic.
- **Validation:**
   - `node src/tools/analysis-run.js --help`
   - `node src/tools/analysis-run.js --skip-pages --skip-domains --dry-run --no-progress-logging`

#### 3.17 db-query.js ✅
- **File:** `tools/db-query.js`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
- **Priority:** LOW
- **Summary:** Refactored the read-only query helper to use `CliArgumentParser` + `CliFormatter`, added `--list` discovery mode, and routed database access through the v1 `openDatabase` helper while preserving clean JSON output for automation.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Standardized CLI options (`--db`, `--sql`, `--file`, `--list`, `--format`, `--limit`, `--quiet`, `--json`) with validation that flags are not combined in unsafe ways and that only read-safe statements are permitted.
   - Replaced manual table rendering with formatter-driven sections (execution metadata, results, summary) including row limiting notices and optional quiet footer suppression.
   - Leveraged `findProjectRoot` for default database resolution, introduced optional `DB_QUERY_DEBUG` logging for positional parsing diagnostics, and ensured SQLite connections open via the shared adapter in read-only/fileMustExist mode.
- **Validation:**
   - `node tools/db-query.js --help`
   - `node tools/db-query.js --list --limit 5`

- **Priority:** LOW
- **Summary:** Rebuilt the table-size analyzer around CliArgumentParser/CliFormatter, added JSON/quiet output, and replaced ad-hoc logging with structured dbstat summaries plus CLI/worker fallbacks.
- **Key Changes:**
   - Introduced standardized options for mode selection (`auto|cli|worker|size`), table limits, JSON output, and download controls using CliArgumentParser.
   - Implemented direct `dbstat` collection via better-sqlite3 with formatter-driven ASCII tables and machine-readable payloads, including file-size context and duration metrics.
   - Preserved sqlite3 CLI and worker-thread fallbacks with guarded downloads, consolidated progress messaging through CliFormatter, and surfaced actionable notes in summaries.
   - Enforced JSON quiet output to honor `--limit`, exposing `tablesDisplayed`/`hiddenTableCount` metadata so automation results align with the ASCII view.
- **Validation:**
   - `node tools/db-table-sizes.js --help`

Tasks map to the expanded modernization initiative captured in `CHANGE_PLAN.md`. Complete after Phase 3A unless dependencies require earlier groundwork.

| # | Task | Scope | Status | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| 4.1 | Candidate Storage & Telemetry Foundations | New `place_hub_candidates` table, shared `recordFetchResult`, HubValidator HTML reuse + metrics | ✅ COMPLETED | HIGH | Unlocks downstream batching and audit workflows — 2025-10-30: HubValidator now accepts provided HTML and emits structured metrics; guess-place-hubs now writes candidates + validation telemetry via shared fetch recorder |
| 4.2 | CLI Workflow Enhancements | Multi-domain batching, CSV `--import`, `--apply` diff preview, `--emit-report` JSON snapshots | ✅ COMPLETED | HIGH | Steps 0-6 complete; testing (step 6) completed with 21/21 tests passing. CLI now supports batch processing with diff preview, report emission, and readiness timeout budgeting. |
| 4.3 | Swagger/OpenAPI Server Infrastructure | Standalone OpenAPI 3.x server with full API documentation, UI-independent endpoints | 🚧 IN_PROGRESS | HIGH | Stage 1 complete: Orchestration layer extracted, API routes implemented, tests passing (5/5). CLI tool refactored to use orchestration layer (removed 1194 lines of inline business logic). |

#### Phase 4 Sub-Phase Tracker
- **Active phase:** Phase 4 — Hub Guessing Workflow Modernization
- **Current sub-phase:** γ — Implementation & validation (entered 2025-10-30)
- **Sub-phase timeline:**
   - α — Deep discovery & tooling inventory (completed 2025-10-30)
   - β — Plan & documentation (completed 2025-10-30)
- **Docs consulted during α:** `AGENTS.md` (Topic Index), `docs/PLACE_HUB_HIERARCHY.md`, `docs/hub-content-analysis-workflow.md`, `CHANGE_PLAN_HUB_GAP_ANALYZER.md`
- **Code reconnaissance:** `src/tools/guess-place-hubs.js`, `src/db/placeHubCandidatesStore.js`, `src/db/sqlite/v1/queries/guessPlaceHubsQueries.js`, `src/hub-validation/HubValidator.js`
- **Tooling inventory:** Current CLI summary renderer, `place_hub_candidates` store, `createFetchRecorder` instrumentation, existing guess→validate flow
- **Risks noted:** Applying multi-domain batches must avoid duplicate hub writes, diff preview needs transaction-safe staging, CSV import must normalize domains consistently
- **β objectives:** Maintain `CHANGE_PLAN.md` as single source of truth (done), expand task breakdown for 4.2–4.6, and prepare validation/test matrices prior to implementation

#### Task 4.2 Execution Breakdown (β planning)
0. ✅ Break the `ensureDb` ⇄ `seed-utils` circular require so SQLite helpers load without warnings (plan documented in `CHANGE_PLAN.md`, remove unused imports, verify via CLI smoke test).
1. ✅ Extend argument parsing to accept multiple domains (`--domain` repeatable, positional list, `--domains`, `--import` CSV) and produce normalized batch descriptors.
2. ✅ Introduce batch orchestrator (`runGuessPlaceHubsBatch`) that iterates domains sequentially, reusing existing `guessPlaceHubs` core and aggregating summaries. *Orchestrator complete with readiness timeout budgeting, probe diagnostics, and diff preview rendering.*
3. ✅ Implement diff preview pipeline for `--apply` (collect existing hubs, compute insert/update sets, render via CliFormatter, expose JSON payload). *Multi-domain ASCII tables live; JSON summaries now include cloned diff arrays + counts for aggregate and per-domain views.*
4. ✅ Add `--emit-report` support (optional path or auto timestamp) emitting structured JSON for each run; include per-domain stats, candidate metrics, diff preview, error summaries. *Report writer complete with enriched payloads including `candidateMetrics` (generated/cached/validated/persisted), `validationSummary` (pass/fail/reasons), diff preview, timing metadata, and per-domain breakdowns.*
5. ✅ Update CLI summary renderer for batch output (per-domain tables + roll-up stats) while retaining quiet/JSON behaviors. *Batch summaries now surface run duration, validation counts, and top failure reasons.*
6. ⬜ Ensure candidate store + fetch recorder remain compatible with batch processing (reset attempt counters, run IDs) and add focused tests/fixtures covering new paths.

- ✅ Completed Task 2.6 (Refactor HubValidator as facade) - Successfully refactored HubValidator.js from 967 lines to ~200 lines by delegating to 5 specialized modules while maintaining full backward compatibility.
- ✅ Created facade pattern implementation that coordinates HubNormalizer, HubCacheManager, HubUrlValidator, HubContentAnalyzer, and HubValidationEngine modules.
- ✅ Verified facade functionality with comprehensive test covering URL normalization, title extraction, and place hub validation.
- ✅ Updated task tracking: HubValidator modularization complete (6/6 tasks).
- 🏁 HubValidator modularization complete. Codebase now has improved maintainability with focused, testable modules.

### Session 29: October 31, 2025
- ✅ Completed Task 4.7 (Testing & Documentation Updates) - Created comprehensive mixed response fixtures and updated documentation for the modernized guess → validate → export workflow.
- ✅ Created `tests/fixtures/mixed-hub-responses.js` with realistic response scenarios (success, 404, rate limit, server errors, redirects).
- ✅ Added `tests/fixtures/mixed-hub-responses.test.js` with comprehensive fixture tests (9/9 passing).
- ✅ Updated `docs/PLACE_HUB_HIERARCHY.md` with current implementation status and complete workflow documentation.
- ✅ Added guess → validate → export workflow guide with CLI examples and new features.
- ✅ Documented batch processing, CSV import, JSON reporting, and hierarchical discovery capabilities.
- 🏁 **CLI REFACTORING SESSION COMPLETE** - All 32 tasks completed (100% success rate).
- **Final Status:** Hub guessing workflow fully modernized with comprehensive observability, audit trails, and testing infrastructure.

### Session 30: October 31, 2025
- ✅ Deduplicated GET decision logging in `src/orchestration/DomainProcessor.js` so guess-place-hubs summaries record a single fetch outcome per attempt while keeping capture/persistence logic unchanged.

### Session 31: October 31, 2025
- ✅ Entered Phase 5 (Repository Utility Tooling) and completed discovery/planning for Task 5.1 (`count-json-files` CLI).
- ✅ Implemented `tools/count-json-files.js` using CliFormatter/CliArgumentParser, recursive directory traversal, ASCII summary, and JSON payload support.
- ✅ Validation: `node tools/count-json-files.js --root .` (ASCII) and `node tools/count-json-files.js --root . --summary-format json --quiet` (JSON) — outputs large due to node_modules but sorted correctly.
- 🏁 Phase 5A complete; awaiting operator feedback for potential filters/limits before closing phase formally.

### Session 32: October 31, 2025
- 🔄 Operator requested console table mode (non-JSON) plus modularized table writer for `count-json-files`.
- ✅ Implemented `tools/lib/json-count-table.js`, added `--table` alias + `table` summary format, and refactored CLI summaries to use the modular renderer.
- ✅ Updated traversal to aggregate nested JSON counts (total + direct), ensuring directories with the largest JSON footprint bubble to the top of both ASCII and table summaries.
- ✅ Validation: `node tools/count-json-files.js --root tmp --summary-format table` and `node tools/count-json-files.js --root tmp --summary-format json --quiet`.
- 🏁 Phase 5A closed again — tracker restored to 33/33 tasks complete pending future enhancements.

### Session 33: October 31, 2025
- ✅ Added a shared `--limit` flag to `count-json-files` so ASCII/table reports can focus on the top-N directories, mirroring truncation metadata in JSON payloads.
- ✅ Updated the reusable table helper to support limits and surface displayed vs. hidden directory counts for summary messaging.
- ✅ Validation: `node tools/count-json-files.js --root . --summary-format table --limit 25` and `node tools/count-json-files.js --root . --summary-format json --quiet --limit 25` (confirms truncation metadata and quiet JSON compliance).

### Session 34: October 31, 2025
- ✅ Added total bytes calculation for JSON files per directory, with formatted size column in tables (e.g., "144.1 MB").
- ✅ Modified traversal to sum file sizes, updated data structures, and added formatBytes utility for human-readable display.
- ✅ Updated table helper to include Size column with formatter integration.
- ✅ Validation: `node tools/count-json-files.js --root . --summary-format table --limit 5` shows Size column with proper formatting.
- 🏁 Phase 5 complete — count-json-files tool fully implemented with all requested features.

### Session 35: October 31, 2025
- ✅ Completed Task 6.1 (WikidataAdm1Ingestor Integration) - Replaced filesystem caching with HttpRequestResponseFacade.
- ✅ Completed Task 6.2 (WikidataCountryIngestor Integration) - Replaced entity batch caching with facade calls.
- ✅ Completed Task 6.3 (populate-gazetteer SPARQL Integration) - Replaced SPARQL filesystem caching with facade.
- ✅ Completed Task 6.4 (Remove Old Cache Files) - Cleaned up 727+ old cache files from filesystem.
- 🏁 Phase 6 complete — HTTP caching unification successful, all Wikidata filesystem caching migrated to database.

### Session 36: October 31, 2025
- ✅ Hardened `analysis.analysePagesCore` URL normalization lookups so `getPlaceHubByUrl` resolves `url_id` via `UrlResolver` with guarded error capturing, keeping post-migration hub lookups stable after dropping legacy TEXT URL columns.

### Session 37: October 31, 2025
- ✅ Closed Task 7.1 by updating normalization tooling documentation to reflect the new short-circuit/drop-safe behavior and confirming scripts guard for missing `article_url` columns while maintaining `idx_article_places_url_id`.
- 🔄 Task 7.2 kicked off (γ sub-phase): inventoried remaining runtime callers, confirmed deprecated UI `gazetteerPlace` still joins on legacy TEXT column, and drafted adapter-based refactor plan with focused Jest coverage target.
- ✅ Gazetted Jest coverage: refactored `gazetteerPlace.data.test.js` to operate in schemas that lack `articles`/`article_places`, confirming adapter fallbacks return empty arrays without throwing and keeping hub listings intact.
- ✅ Extended coverage to `gazetteer.api.test.js`, seeding databases without the legacy `articles` table, updating expectations for the structured response payload, and confirming the `/api/gazetteer/articles` route downgrades to the fallback system cleanly.
- 📚 Docs touched: `docs/DATABASE_URL_NORMALIZATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/CHANGE_PLAN.md`, `docs/API_ENDPOINT_REFERENCE.md`; tracker updated with sub-phase status and 7.2 checklist.

## Refactoring Checklist (Per Task)

For each tool, follow this checklist:

- [ ] Read source file (check structure, current output)
- [ ] Identify argument parsing location
- [ ] Identify output/console.log calls
- [ ] Create backup notes
- [ ] Add imports: `CliFormatter`, `CliArgumentParser`
- [ ] Replace argument parsing with CliArgumentParser
- [ ] Replace console.log calls with fmt.* methods
- [ ] Add header/footer structure
- [ ] Move any inline SQL to `src/db/sqlite/v1/queries/` adapters (extend existing factories or create new ones)
- [ ] Test with --help flag
- [ ] Mark task COMPLETE in this document
- [ ] Commit changes with reference to task number

## Notes & Special Cases

### Tools Already Using Colors
- ✅ validate-gazetteer.js — Refactored ✅
- ✅ analyze-domains.js — Refactored ✅
- ✅ detect-articles.js — Refactored ✅
- ⏳ crawl-place-hubs.js — May already have good colors (review first)

### Complex Tools Requiring Extra Care
- `populate-gazetteer.js` — Multiple sub-commands, may need subcommand support
- `export-gazetteer.js` — File I/O, progress tracking
- `get-test-summary.js` — Complex data aggregation

### Tools to Skip/Review First
- `compression-benchmark.cjs` — Benchmark, may not need CLI formatting
- `db-query.js` — Infrastructure utility
- `analysis-run.js` — Background task runner

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Phase 3C autonomously:**
   - Execute task 3.15 sequentially (intelligent-crawl.js)
   - Update this document after each task
   - Capture validation commands alongside changes

2. **Track progress:**
   - Update task status transitions and batch completion percentages
   - Record notable changes/edge cases for each tool
   - Document any blockers before moving to the next task

3. **Plan Phase 3D review** once Phase 3C wraps (determine which tools need refactors vs. skip)

4. **Final summary** after all phases complete

## Document Maintenance

This document is the single source of truth for refactoring progress. Update it:
- **After each task completion** — Mark as ✅ COMPLETE, record changes
- **When moving to new batch** — Update batch status
- **If blockers encountered** — Document in Notes section
- **At end of session** — Add session summary to Execution Log

**Golden Rule:** Every change in the codebase has a corresponding update in this document.
