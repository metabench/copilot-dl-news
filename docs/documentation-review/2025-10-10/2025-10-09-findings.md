# Documentation Review Findings — 2025-10-09

Generated via `tools/docs/generate-doc-inventory.js` and manual spot checks.

## Phase 1 — Discovery & Audit

- Baseline (prior to fixes): 76 Markdown documents, **49%** in `AGENTS.md`, **13%** with "When to Read", 18 with zero cross-references.
- Current (after improvements & new review docs): 80 Markdown documents, **61%** in `AGENTS.md`, **30%** with "When to Read", **0** with zero cross-references.
- Artifacts produced:
  - `2025-10-09-inventory.json`
  - `2025-10-09-summary.json`
  - `2025-10-09-missing-in-agents.md`
  - `2025-10-09-needs-when-to-read.md`
  - `2025-10-09-zero-crossrefs.md`
  - `2025-10-09-findings.md` (this log)

### Quick Wins Identified

1. Add remaining orphaned docs (31) to the `AGENTS.md` Topic Index.
2. Provide "When to Read" metadata for the remaining high-impact docs (56 outstanding).
3. Highlight documentation for lang-tools, telemetry/SSE, and specialized E2E suites.

## Phase 2 — Content Review Highlights

| Document | Status Check | Action Taken |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/DATABASE_NORMALIZATION_PLAN.md` | Up to date but lacked entry guidance | Added **When to Read** section |
| `docs/SERVICE_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Accurate; missing discoverability cues | Added **When to Read** section |
| `docs/COMPRESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_FULL.md` | Accurate; guidance missing | Added **When to Read** section |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md` | Metrics accurate; lacked usage notes | Added **When to Read** section |
| `docs/LANG_TOOLS_ARCHITECTURAL_PATTERNS.md` | Still relevant; needed context | Added **When to Read** section |

Outstanding: 56 docs still require "When to Read" metadata (see `2025-10-09-needs-when-to-read.md`).

## Phase 3 — Gap Analysis

- **Language tools** documentation cluster was not linked from `AGENTS.md` → now referenced, though 31 documents overall still sit outside the index.
- **Telemetry & SSE** docs (`E2E_TEST_PROGRESS_LOGGING.md`, `SSE_CLOSURE_ARCHITECTURE.md`) were hidden → surfaced in Topic Index.
- **Operations** docs (`NEWS_WEBSITES_STATS_CACHE.md`, `SERVER_ROOT_VERIFICATION.md`) lacked cross-links → added.
- README and test-centric READMEs remain outside the index pending decision (need clarity on inclusion policy).

### Open Gaps / Next Actions

1. Extend "When to Read" coverage to remaining high-impact docs (compression buckets, geography E2E guides, planning retrospectives).
2. Evaluate whether root `README.md` and `tests/` READMEs should appear in the Topic Index or a separate quick-start section.
3. Review investigation docs (`ANALYSIS_PAGE_ISSUES.md`, `GEOGRAPHY_CRAWL_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`) for archival vs. active relevance.
4. Automate cross-reference checks inside CI to flag newly orphaned documentation.

## Phase 4 — Improvements Implemented

- Generated repeatable inventory tooling (`tools/docs/generate-doc-inventory.js`).
- Added Topic Index coverage for 11 previously orphaned domains (language tools, telemetry, operations, planning).
- Injected **When to Read** sections into five priority documents.

## Phase 5 — Validation Snapshot

- Spot-check: navigating from `AGENTS.md` to lang-tools docs now requires <10 seconds.
- Compression implementation + database normalization docs now provide entry guidance.
- Inventory regeneration confirms discoverability improvement from **49% → 61%** (37 → 49 docs listed) and "When to Read" coverage from **13% → 30%**, with zero documents now lacking cross-references.

## Phase 6 — Process Notes

- Inventory script now produces actionable Markdown reports; future cycles should re-run before and after changes to quantify impact.
- Consider parameterizing script output locations (CLI args) to support historical trend storage.
- Next iteration should broaden content review sampling to investigation and README files before archiving decisions.
