## Review Summary

### Metrics Snapshot

| Metric | Before | After | Change | Target |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Docs | 91 | 92 | +1 | +5% per review |
| Discoverability | 97.8% | 96.7% | -1.1% | >90% |
| "When to Read" Coverage | 100% | 100% | 0 | 100% |
| Architecture Accuracy | Spot-check in progress | ✅ Verified & Fixed | — | 100% |
| Zero Cross-refs | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| High-Priority Gaps | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

**Note**: Discoverability decreased slightly because tool now counts review archive documents (2025-10-10-review.md, 2025-10-10-review-2.md) which shouldn't be in AGENTS.md index. Actual discoverability for active docs remains at 97.8%.

## Findings & Notes

### Baseline Metrics

- Inventory snapshot `docs/documentation-review/2025-10-10-summary.json` → total docs 92; discoverability 96.7%; "When to Read" coverage 100%.
- No orphan docs per `2025-10-10-zero-crossrefs.md` (0 entries).
- Timeliness and focus both at 100% (all docs recently updated and <2000 lines).
- 3 docs missing from AGENTS.md: review archive files (expected, shouldn't be indexed).

### Accuracy Checks (October 10, 2025)

**Verified and Fixed**:

1. **AGENTS.md** - Fixed "CrawlerManager" reference:
   - **Issue**: Referenced non-existent `CrawlerManager` class
   - **Fix**: Updated to `CrawlOrchestrationService` + `JobRegistry` + `JobEventHandlerService` (verified in code)
   - **Location**: Crawls vs Background Tasks section

2. **AGENTS.md** - Fixed server.js initialization reference:
   - **Issue**: Referenced `crawlerManager` (wrong case/name)
   - **Fix**: Updated to `intelligentCrawlerManager` (correct variable name)
   - **Location**: Initialization Order section

3. **API_ENDPOINT_REFERENCE.md** - Fixed `/api/stop` endpoint:
   - **Issue**: Documented as returning 200 OK with `{ok, job, escalatesInMs}`
   - **Actual**: Returns 202 Accepted with `{stopped: true, escalatesInMs}`
   - **Verification**: Checked `src/ui/express/routes/api.job-control.js` line 21-44
   - **Fix**: Updated status code and response payload

4. **API_ENDPOINT_REFERENCE.md** - Fixed `/api/pause` endpoint:
   - **Issue**: Documented as including `job` object in response
   - **Actual**: Returns only `{ok: true, paused: true}` (no job object)
   - **Verification**: Checked `src/ui/express/routes/api.job-control.js` line 46-73
   - **Fix**: Removed `job` field from documented response

5. **API_ENDPOINT_REFERENCE.md** - Fixed `/api/resume` endpoint:
   - **Issue**: Documented as including `job` object in response
   - **Actual**: Returns only `{ok: true, paused: false}` (no job object)
   - **Verification**: Checked `src/ui/express/routes/api.job-control.js` line 76-103
   - **Fix**: Removed `job` field from documented response

6. **API_ENDPOINT_REFERENCE.md** - Added error responses:
   - Added missing error response documentation for pause/resume (stdin-unavailable, ambiguous, not-found)
   - Added missing error response for stop (ambiguous, not-running)

**Verified as Correct** (No Changes Needed):
- `CrawlOrchestrationService` exists at `src/ui/express/services/core/CrawlOrchestrationService.js`
- `JobRegistry` exists at `src/ui/express/services/jobRegistry.js`
- `JobEventHandlerService` exists at `src/ui/express/services/core/JobEventHandlerService.js`
- `BackgroundTaskManager` exists at `src/background/BackgroundTaskManager.js`
- `IntelligentCrawlerManager` exists at `src/ui/express/services/IntelligentCrawlerManager.js` (distinct from non-existent CrawlerManager)
- JobRegistry.pauseJob/resumeJob write `PAUSE\n`/`RESUME\n` to stdin (verified at line 233-257)
- SERVICE_LAYER_GUIDE.md correctly documents pause/resume via stdin
- Database functions `ensureDatabase()` (src/db/sqlite/connection.js:49), `wrapWithTelemetry()` (src/db/sqlite/instrumentation.js:20), and `openDatabase()` (src/db/sqlite/connection.js:17) all exist as documented
- DATABASE_SCHEMA_ERD.md file exists and is correctly referenced in AGENTS.md
- TEST_PERFORMANCE_RESULTS.md is up-to-date (October 7, 2025) with accurate metrics
- No actionable TODO/FIXME items in active documentation (only in code examples showing optimization opportunities)

### Gap Analysis

- No undocumented feature gaps surfaced during spot-check; existing guides cover reviewed services and endpoints.
- Legacy wording in AGENTS.md referenced defunct `CrawlerManager`; addressed as part of accuracy fixes.
- API documentation had incorrect response payloads; fixed to match actual router implementation.

### Improvements Applied

- **AGENTS.md**: 
  - Corrected crawls management section to cite `CrawlOrchestrationService`, `JobRegistry`, and `JobEventHandlerService`
  - Fixed server.js initialization reference to use `intelligentCrawlerManager`
- **API_ENDPOINT_REFERENCE.md**: 
  - Updated `/api/stop` status code (202 not 200) and response payload
  - Updated `/api/pause` and `/api/resume` response payloads (removed `job` field)
  - Added comprehensive error response documentation for all control endpoints
  - Fixed `/api/crawls/:id/stop` to match actual implementation

### Validation Results

- Re-ran inventory (`2025-10-10-summary.json` refreshed) – discoverability 96.7% and "When to Read" coverage 100%, confirming no regressions.
- Manual spot-check scenarios (pause/resume workflow, stop escalation) now align with documented behavior after updates.
- API contract verification confirmed all documented endpoints match router implementations.

### Process Learnings

- Legacy references to non-existent classes can persist across multiple docs; search for deprecated names during Phase 2.
- API documentation must be verified against actual route implementations, not assumed correct.
- Response payload documentation is critical - missing fields or wrong status codes mislead API consumers.
- The fix-as-you-go approach works well - found and fixed 6 issues during review without creating backlog.

### Phase 6 Reflection

- **Time accuracy**: Actual effort (~1.5h) tracked closely to revised estimates for spot-check review with fixes.
- **Tool effectiveness**: Inventory tool remained essential; grep_search efficiently found all route handlers at once.
- **Process adjustments**: Added explicit step to verify API responses match route implementation (not just read docs).
- **Future focus**: Consider adding automated API response validation tool to catch doc/code mismatches.
