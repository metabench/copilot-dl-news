# Communication Standards

## Chat Summaries

- Keep responses to 1–2 sentences summarizing action and result.
- Highlight blockers explicitly; otherwise assume success.

## Documentation Updates

- Update canonical docs when guidance changes; avoid creating standalone summary notes for routine tasks.
- Archive completed initiative retrospectives outside of `AGENTS.md` while surfacing key lessons in canonical docs.
