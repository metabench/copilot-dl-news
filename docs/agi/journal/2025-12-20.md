# 2025-12-20 — UI + UI Dev Process Improvements

Session: `docs/sessions/2025-12-20-ui-dev-improvements/`

## Headline

The repo already has strong primitives for a premium, reliable UI (WLILO tokens, theme persistence, SSR checks, Puppeteer console capture). The biggest remaining UI wins are *finishing the theme editor and tightening navigation + tables*, plus *making the UI dev loop faster*.

## Highest-leverage next moves

1) **Finish Theme Editor UI + `/theme` route**
- Theme persistence is already implemented in `src/ui/server/services/themeService.js` (system themes include WLILO + Obsidian).
- The theme plan exists, but the editor control/route appears missing in current `src/ui`.

2) **Data Explorer command header**
- Breadcrumbs + quick actions + route index so every view is self-locating.

3) **Standardize table UX**
- Sticky headers, sorting, column chooser, row expansion, and performance hygiene (keep control count lean).

4) **Unify the UI dev loop**
- Promote a single `ui:watch` command (CSS build + client build + server restart).

## Verification discipline

- Markup-only changes: run the nearest `src/ui/**/checks/*.check.js`.
- Browser behavior/layout: use `node tools/dev/ui-console-capture.js ...` first.
- Multi-step flows/regressions: add a deterministic scenario suite per `puppeteer-efficient-ui-verification`.
