# 2025-11-16 – AGI Documentation Kickoff

## Sense
- Repository lacks `/docs/agi` materials; AGI initiative starting from scratch.
- Existing guidance concentrated in `AGENTS.md` and tooling docs (js-scan, js-edit) that need to be referenced.

## Plan for This Session
1. Establish `/docs/agi` scaffold (index, self-model, workflows, tools, library overview, research backlog, lessons, journal, agents).
2. Capture baseline description of current agent/tool ecosystem with emphasis on static analysis (js-scan/js-edit) and roadmap toward AGI workflows.
3. Draft AGI Documentation Scout spec under `/docs/agi/agents/` to guide future iterations.

## Agent Landscape Notes
- Reviewed `docs/agents/agent_policy.md` and `docs/agents/docs_indexer_and_agents_refactorer.md` to understand existing governance.
- Confirmed Research-First directives (index-first, minimal doc set) and documentation maintenance expectations.
- Identified owners (docs-indexer) and canonical status for key policies, ensuring future AGI agents reference them before proposing new personas.

## Module Survey Highlights
- Enumerated top-level modules under `/src` (crawler, services, db, planner, api, analysis, orchestration, etc.) to inform AGI module summaries.
- Inspected `src/crawler/`, `src/services/`, `src/db/`, and `src/planner/` subtrees to map critical components (IntelligentPlanningFacade, Hub Gap analyzers, adapter architecture).
- Noted need to cross-link existing architecture docs (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE_*`, `HUB_EXTENSIBILITY_*`) within the AGI library overview when summarizing modules.

## Tooling Research
- Reviewed `tools/dev/README.md` for js-scan/js-edit advanced invocation patterns (bilingual flags, ripple analysis, recipe support).
- Skimmed `tools/dev/js-scan.js` plus `tools/dev/js-scan/operations/*` to understand internal modules (search, patterns, rippleAnalysis, callGraph, dependencies, relationships).
- Captured follow-up tasks: document js-scan best practices, describe meta-scans (running js-scan on js-scan), and bake guidance into `docs/agi/tools/`.
- Authored `docs/agi/tools/JS_SCAN_DEEP_DIVE.md` with commands for module reconnaissance and meta-analysis of the tooling itself.
- Next objective: mirror this effort for `js-edit` by documenting its operations modules, guard workflows, recipe orchestrations, and meta-use (running js-edit over its own sources).
- Completed `docs/agi/tools/JS_EDIT_DEEP_DIVE.md`, covering architecture, guard workflows, module recipes, and self-editing commands.

## Open Questions
- Which additional repositories or external systems feed into the AGI roadmap?
- What cadence should future agents follow for updating the research backlog and lessons learned?

## Session Log – 2025-11-16 jsgui3 Isomorphic Diagram Atlas

**Sense**: Reviewed `src/ui/server/diagramAtlasServer.js`, `src/ui/controls/DiagramAtlasControls.js`, and `src/ui/client/index.js` to map current SSR vs. client hydration gaps; confirmed only the server path uses jsgui3 builders.

**Plan**: Captured `docs/sessions/2025-11-16-jsgui3-isomorphic-diagram-atlas/PLAN.md` (share diagram controls, hydrate via jsgui, verify via check + Jest e2e).

**Act (in progress)**: Preparing shared factory for diagram controls and updating the client bundle to render fetched `/api/diagram-data` payloads via jsgui3.

**Verify (pending)**: Will run `node src/ui/server/checks/diagramAtlas.check.js` plus `npm run test:by-path tests/server/diagram-atlas.e2e.test.js` once the shared implementation lands, alongside a hydration check.
