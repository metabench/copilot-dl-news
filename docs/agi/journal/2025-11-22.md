# 2025-11-22 – Data Explorer Wide-Lens Polish

## Sense
- Reviewed the shared jsgui `renderHtml()` helper plus `src/ui/server/dataExplorerServer.js` to confirm every view (URLs, Domains, Crawls, Errors, detail routes) inherits the same layout shell.
- Compared against the Diagram Atlas session to mirror its tidy typography + hero treatment and noted we still lacked a quick `dataExplorer` check script for regressions.

## Plan
- Refresh the shared CSS so headers/meta cards/home cards scale up cleanly to ~1760px viewports and subtitle text doesn’t wrap awkwardly.
- Rework the header markup to introduce a hero layout with a dedicated action slot for the filter toggle.
- Add a lightweight check script plus run the server + production Jest suites to lock in the makeover.

## Act
- Rebuilt `buildCss()` with hero/header/home-grid/media-query tweaks (balanced subtitles, flex header, upgraded meta-card/table/pager styling) so text stays crisp even on ultra-wide monitors.
- Updated `renderHtml()` to wrap headings + subtitle inside `.page-shell__hero` and dock filter controls inside `.page-shell__actions` for better alignment.
- Exported `DATA_VIEWS` + `renderUrlListingView` and created `src/ui/server/checks/dataExplorer.check.js` to dump a `/urls` preview HTML artifact on demand.

## Verify
- `node src/ui/server/checks/dataExplorer.check.js`
- `npm run test:by-path tests/ui/server/dataExplorerServer.test.js`
- `npm run test:by-path tests/ui/server/dataExplorerServer.production.test.js`

## Next
- Capture refreshed screenshots for the documentation gallery once the wider layout is approved.
- Propagate the hero/action pattern to remaining jsgui pages (diagram drilldowns, detail routes) so the UI surface stays consistent.

## Update — 2025-11-17 jsgui-forward Follow-Up

- Re-read `docs/CLIENT_MODULARIZATION_PLAN.md` and the session Working Notes to confirm the Diagram Atlas bootstrap + shared listing store extraction scope.
- Validated the modularized client entry by running:
	- `node src/ui/server/checks/diagramAtlas.check.js`
	- `node src/ui/server/checks/dataExplorer.check.js`
	- `npm run test:by-path tests/ui/server/dataExplorerServer.test.js`
	- `npm run test:by-path tests/ui/server/dataExplorerServer.production.test.js`
- Updated `docs/agi/WORKFLOWS.md` with a dedicated jsgui-forward workflow and added an addendum to `docs/JSGUI3_PATTERNS_ANALYSIS.md` capturing the Diagram Atlas + listing store modularization playbook.
