# 2025-12-13 — Anthropic Skills pattern → Copilot/MCP

## Known facts
- Claude Code “Agent Skills” are directory-based capability packs (`SKILL.md` + optional scripts/templates), invoked automatically based on the Skill description.
- Subagents can be configured separately and can auto-load skills.
- Slash commands are explicit prompt snippets; docs contrast them with Skills for complex workflows.

## Mapping to this repo
- We already have “knowledge artifacts” (workflows/patterns/lessons/sessions) and “specialists” (agents).
- Missing piece is a first-class, discoverable **capability pack registry** (triggers + SOP + scripts + tests + success criteria) that agents can query in a structured way.

## Proposal
- Treat “Skills” as a design pattern and implement a repo-native version via `docs/agi/skills/` plus docs-memory MCP tool support (`listSkills/getSkill/searchSkills`).

## 2025-12-13 — Tooling: agent capability matrix + multi-file Markdown edits

## Known facts
- Systemic rollouts (like “memory-first + error escalation” across many `.github/agents/*.agent.md`) are currently too manual.
- There is precedent for frontmatter validation and tooling batch plans in older sessions (notably `fix-agi-orchestrator-agent` and js-edit batch docs).

## Proposal
- Add a structured **agent capability matrix** output (prefer a thin `agent-matrix` CLI first, or extend `md-scan`).
- Add `md-edit` **multi-file** operations with `--dry-run` default, per-file diff previews, and an idempotent `--ensure-present` mode.

## Session link
- See `docs/sessions/2025-12-13-md-scan-agent-feature-matrix/` for the design options + handoff notes.
