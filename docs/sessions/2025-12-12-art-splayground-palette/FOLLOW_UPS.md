# Follow Ups – Art Splayground: color palette + selection

- Add a “recent colors” row for Fill/Stroke (track last ~8 swatches used).
- Add keyboard accessibility for swatches (arrow keys + Enter/Space) and `aria-label` for each swatch.
- Consider wiring the existing `ColorSelectorControl` into the properties panel (or delete it if it stays unused).
- Optional: expand palette-driven props beyond color (stroke width, opacity) while keeping undo/redo clean.
