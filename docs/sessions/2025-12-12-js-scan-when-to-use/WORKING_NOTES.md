# Working Notes – When to use js-scan (agent guidance)

- 2025-12-12 — Session created via CLI. Add incremental notes here.

- 2025-12-12 00:20 — - Updated AGENTS.md: clarified when to use js-scan vs grep/read_file, with a Data Explorer-style inventory example command.
- Rationale: js-scan is best for multi-file inventories + dependency questions; grep/read_file is fine for tight, known-local edits.
