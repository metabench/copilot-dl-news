# Session Summary

## Completed
- Created session scaffolding plus hub entry and captured relocation plan/notes.
- Moved 15 documentation files out of the repository root:
	- Promoted `AGENT_TOOLING_ENHANCEMENTS_PROPOSAL.md` to `docs/`.
	- Parked historical `AGENTS_*` variants under `docs/archives/agents/` (with README).
	- Stored remaining reports/plans under `docs/root-migration/` alongside a README that lists each file awaiting categorization.
- Updated `docs/INDEX.md` (reference + new “Legacy Collections” section) so the relocated artifacts are discoverable.
- Refreshed cross-doc references (e.g., `docs/WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGY.md`, `docs/WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION_VISUAL_GUIDE.md`, `docs/TIER_1_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`, `docs/root-migration/TOOLING_ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`) to target the new paths.

## Follow-ups
- Re-classify each `docs/root-migration/*.md` file into a permanent subdirectory (reports, workflows, etc.) and update the index accordingly.
- Consider trimming or archiving duplicate planning docs (e.g., second `CHANGE_PLAN.md`) once consolidation strategy is defined.
