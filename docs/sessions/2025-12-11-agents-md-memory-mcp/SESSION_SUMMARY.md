# Session Summary – Add docs-memory MCP usage to AGENTS.md

## Accomplishments
- Added a “docs-memory (MCP)” primer to AGENTS.md to guide agents on when/how to use the memory server (search first, write small reusable updates, default targets).

## Metrics / Evidence
- `git status -sb --untracked-files=no` shows AGENTS.md modified.

## Decisions
- No design trade-offs; kept it as a short “quick anchors” entry to avoid bloating AGENTS.md.

## Next Steps
- None.
