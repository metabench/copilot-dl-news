# Follow Ups – Crawler Documentation Coverage & Accuracy

- Add a short note clarifying CLI entrypoints (`src/crawl.js` vs repo-root `crawl.js`) and which is canonical for which workflow.
- Decide whether to reintroduce `npm run gui` as a compatibility alias for the deprecated Express server (or keep it intentionally absent).
- Link the crawler roadmap from any other “front door” docs that new contributors read first (e.g., docs/reference/project_overview.md).
