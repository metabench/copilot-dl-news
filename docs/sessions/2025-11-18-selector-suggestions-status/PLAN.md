# Plan: Selector Suggestions Status

Objective: Determine the implementation and documentation status of `--suggest-selectors` in `js-edit`.

Done when:
- [x] Implementation status verified in `tools/dev/js-edit.js` (Implemented but hidden)
- [x] Documentation status verified in `docs/` (User guide yes, Reference no)
- [ ] Tests added for `--suggest-selectors`
- [ ] CLI help text updated in `tools/dev/js-edit.js`
- [ ] Reference docs updated in `tools/dev/README.md`
- [ ] User informed of current state

Change set:
- `tools/dev/js-edit.js` (Help text)
- `tools/dev/README.md` (Reference docs)
- `tests/tools/js-edit-suggestions.test.js` (New test)

Risks/assumptions:
- Feature might be partially implemented or just documented as a future feature.
