# Follow Ups – Unified App: mount Crawl Observer

- Owner: Implementation — Mount Crawl Observer router into Unified App and update sub-app registry embed.
- Owner: Tests — Extend `tests/ui/unifiedApp.registry.test.js` to assert Crawl Observer embed path.
- Owner: CLI/Memory — docs-memory `findOrContinueSession("unified-app crawl observer")` returned 0 results even though the session exists (potential indexing/search mismatch).
