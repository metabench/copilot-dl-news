# Roadmap

1. Inventory `/urls` toggle behavior + API expectations.
2. Decide on data strategy (fixture DB vs. mock API) for deterministic Puppeteer runs.
3. Build shared helper to boot `src/ui/server/dataExplorerServer.js` for tests.
4. Author Puppeteer spec covering toggle interactions + DOM assertions.
5. Wire test into existing runners and document commands.
