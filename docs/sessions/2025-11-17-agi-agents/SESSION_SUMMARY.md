# Session Summary

## Outcomes
- Added the `2025-11-17-agi-agents` session to `docs/sessions/SESSIONS_HUB.md` and established PLAN / WORKING_NOTES scaffolding.
- Updated `.github/agents/AGI-Orchestrator.agent.md` with session/todo enforcement, a reusable plan template, and explicit AGI-Scout handoff guidance.
- Expanded `.github/agents/AGI-Scout.agent.md` to cover research mode, session documentation, backlog logging, and journaling requirements.
- Refreshed `.github/agents/Careful js-edit Refactor.agent.md` with orchestrator handoff intake steps, approved Jest runners, and tooling escalation instructions.
- Strengthened `.github/agents/Upgrade js-md-scan-edit.agent.md` to require session/todo tracking, coordination with orchestrator requests, and mandatory tests/docs updates for every CLI change.

## Follow-ups
- Monitor future orchestrator handoffs to ensure AGI-Scout uses the new research workflow and session updates.
- Next tooling sessions should verify that tests/docs requirements in `Upgrade js-md-scan-edit` are enforced in practice.
