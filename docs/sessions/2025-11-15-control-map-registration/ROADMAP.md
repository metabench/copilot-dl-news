# Roadmap: 2025-11-15 Control Map Registration

## Now
- [ ] Inventory vendor control registration flow (`update_standard_Controls`, `page_context.update_Controls`).
- [ ] Confirm how our bundle seeds `context.map_Controls` during `pre_activate`.
- [ ] Document findings + update client entry if needed.

## Next
- [ ] Rebuild `ui-client.js` and re-run Puppeteer toggle test once code changes exist.
- [ ] Capture any remaining binding/plugin follow-ups.

## Later
- [ ] Evaluate whether the binding plugin should automatically mirror `map_Controls` entries across client/server contexts.
