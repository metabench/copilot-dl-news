# Follow Ups – Audit crawl-widget for decision tree viewer

- _Add actionable follow-ups here._

- 2025-12-20 23:54 — - Owner: UI Singularity — Add a minimal "Open Decision Trees" entry point in crawl-widget (likely external browser via Electron shell) pointing at Data Explorer: http://localhost:4600/decision-trees
- Owner: UI Singularity — Decide whether crawl-widget should also be able to start/stop the Data Explorer server (child process) or rely on user-running it.
- Owner: Config Schema Gatekeeper — Consider adding a config setting for the Data Explorer base URL/port so the widget doesn’t hardcode 4600.
