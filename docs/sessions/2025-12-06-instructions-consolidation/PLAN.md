# Plan – Consolidate agent instructions

## Objective
Move key guidance into AGENTS and slim Copilot file

## Done When
- [ ] Key deliverables are complete and documented in `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`.
- [ ] Tests and validations (if any) are captured in `WORKING_NOTES.md`.
- [ ] Follow-ups are recorded in `FOLLOW_UPS.md`.

## Change Set (initial sketch)
- AGENTS.md (add missing guidance migrated from Copilot file)
- .github/instructions/GitHub Copilot.instructions.md (slim to pointer)

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Duplicating content or losing critical rules during consolidation.
	- Mitigation: Add concise pointers in AGENTS.md; keep Copilot file as redirect; self-review diff for omissions.

## Tests / Validation
- None (documentation-only); self-review for clarity.
