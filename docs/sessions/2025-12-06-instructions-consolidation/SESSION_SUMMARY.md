# Session Summary – Consolidate agent instructions

## Accomplishments
- Added concise UI/SVG/tooling quick anchors to AGENTS.md so jsgui3 rules, collision checks, and tier-1 tooling are visible in the main playbook.
- Slimmed `.github/instructions/GitHub Copilot.instructions.md` to a minimal pointer back to AGENTS.md plus tooling link and validation reminder.

## Metrics / Evidence
- Docs-only change; no tests required.

## Decisions
- Copilot-specific guidance now routes through AGENTS.md; keep Copilot file lean going forward.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for instruction drift; update AGENTS.md first when adding guidance.
