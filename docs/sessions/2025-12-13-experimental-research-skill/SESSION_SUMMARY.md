# Session Summary – Experimental Research Skill (Metacognition + Tooling)

## Accomplishments
- Added a new Skill for experiment-driven research + metacognition: `docs/agi/skills/experimental-research-metacognition/SKILL.md`.
- Registered the Skill in `docs/agi/SKILLS.md` and cross-linked it from `jsgui3-lab-experimentation`.
- Clarified that tooling improvements are optional-by-default but can be autonomous when ROI is high.

## Metrics / Evidence
- _Link to tests, benchmarks, or telemetry supporting the results._

## Decisions
- Tooling improvements: optional by default; autonomously promote repeat workflows when triggers are met (documented in the Skill).

## Next Steps
- _Summarize remaining work or follow-ups._
