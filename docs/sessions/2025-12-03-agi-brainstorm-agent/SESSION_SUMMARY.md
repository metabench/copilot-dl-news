# Session Summary – Create AGI Brainstorm agent

## Accomplishments
- Created `.github/agents/🧠🌩️ AGI Brainstorm.agent.md` defining mission, workflow, constraints, and self-improvement loop for brainstorming efforts.
- Updated PLAN and WORKING_NOTES with concrete deliverables, timestamps, and commands per repository process.

## Metrics / Evidence
- Documentation-only change; verified new agent file renders in VS Code and follows existing agent structure.

## Decisions
- Brainstorming responsibilities will live in the new agent; no additional decision record required.

## Next Steps
- Monitor upcoming sessions for opportunities to invoke the Brainstorm agent and capture lessons in `/docs/agi/LESSONS.md`.
