# Follow Ups – Phase 4 Hub Freshness Control (Fetch Policy)

- Decide how to persist fetch-policy decision traces (DB schema vs telemetry tables); see WORKING_NOTES “Potential gap”.
- If confirmed, update `docs/CRAWL_REFACTORING_TASKS.md` Task 4.9 status/notes (tests + CLI smoke now exist).
- Optional: add one more focused test asserting queue event payload includes policy metadata (only after deciding persistence format).
