# Session Summary – Update Shared Controls Catalog

## Accomplishments
- Updated the canonical shared controls catalog with `SearchFormControl` and `MetricCardControl` entries, including minimal usage examples and key API notes.

## Metrics / Evidence
- Doc-only update.

## Decisions
- Keep reusable controls documented in one place: `docs/guides/JSGUI3_SHARED_CONTROLS_CATALOG.md`.

## Next Steps
- Optional: add check scripts for the new shared controls if/when they become more complex.
