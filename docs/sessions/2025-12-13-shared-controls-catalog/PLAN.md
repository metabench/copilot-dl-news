# Plan – Update Shared Controls Catalog

## Objective
Consolidate newly added reusable jsgui3 controls into the canonical shared-controls catalog and add quick routing pointers.

## Done When
- [x] New shared controls are documented in the canonical catalog.
- [x] Session notes record what changed and where.

## Change Set (initial sketch)
- [docs/guides/JSGUI3_SHARED_CONTROLS_CATALOG.md](../../../docs/guides/JSGUI3_SHARED_CONTROLS_CATALOG.md)

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Doc drift**: keep the shared controls catalog as the single source of truth for reusable controls.

## Tests / Validation
- No code changes required; doc-only update.
