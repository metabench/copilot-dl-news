# Plan: vibe-aligned-singularity-refresh

Objective: Infuse the Singularity Engineer agent brief with the actionable, reader-friendly methodology patterns observed on vibebible.org so agents get faster context and consistent practice steps.

Done when:
- vibebible methodology takeaways are documented and mapped to concrete agent improvements
- `.github/agents/💡Singularity Engineer💡.agent.md` reflects those improvements with clear sections, calls to action, and repeatable workflows
- Session docs capture the research highlights plus any open follow-ups
- `docs/sessions/SESSIONS_HUB.md` references this session for future traceability

Change set: `.github/agents/💡Singularity Engineer💡.agent.md`, `docs/sessions/2025-11-16-singularity-agent-refresh/*`, `docs/sessions/SESSIONS_HUB.md`

Risks/assumptions: Need to interpret vibebible methodology accurately despite being Bible-focused; ensure new guidance stays aligned with repo directives (AGENTS.md, Copilot instructions) and does not conflict with binding plugin mandates.

Tests: Not applicable (documentation-only changes)

Docs to update: This session folder (PLAN, WORKING_NOTES, SESSION_SUMMARY), `docs/sessions/SESSIONS_HUB.md`, and the refreshed agent file.
