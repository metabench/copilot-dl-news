# Session Summary — 2025-11-16 Singularity Agent Refresh

_Status_: Complete

## Highlights
- Captured key patterns from https://www.vibebible.org/bible (docs-first canon, lifecycle framing, AI builder contract) and mapped them to Singularity Engineer responsibilities.
- Rebuilt `.github/agents/💡Singularity Engineer💡.agent.md` into a vibe-style brief with a 10-second overview, explicit agent contract, lifecycle table, docs stack reminders, binding plugin mandate, tooling cards, and strategic mode guidance.

## Outcomes
- Session folder (`PLAN`, `WORKING_NOTES`, `SESSION_SUMMARY`) created plus entry in `docs/sessions/SESSIONS_HUB.md` for traceability.
- Singularity Engineer instructions now emphasize session-first workflows, js-scan/js-edit enforcement, bilingual CLI expectations, and binding plugin stewardship in a concise, repeatable format.

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a lightweight quick-reference card (PDF or image) for the new contract so other agents can embed it easily.
- Monitor future sessions for additional friction and extend the tooling cards (e.g., `js-scan --batch` once released).
