# Follow Ups – Decision Tree Visualization Apps Deep Research

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation (Priority: High)
- [ ] Set up React Flow or D3.js-based canvas
- [ ] Implement basic zoom/pan/grid
- [ ] Create node component library matching SVG designs
- [ ] Add JSON serialization for tree state

### Phase 2: Editing Features (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Implement drag-drop from toolbox to canvas
- [ ] Add connection line drawing between nodes
- [ ] Build property panel with form validation
- [ ] Support undo/redo operations

### Phase 3: Testing & Debug (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Create sample browser component
- [ ] Implement tree evaluation engine
- [ ] Add step-through debugging with audit trail
- [ ] Build batch testing for sample sets

### Phase 4: Polish (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Implement export (SVG, PNG, JSON)
- [ ] Add minimap navigation
- [ ] Consider collaboration features

## Research Extensions

- [ ] Investigate accessibility requirements (ARIA roles for trees)
- [ ] Research animation libraries for evaluation flow visualization
- [ ] Explore AI-assisted node suggestion features
- [ ] Consider mobile/touch support requirements
