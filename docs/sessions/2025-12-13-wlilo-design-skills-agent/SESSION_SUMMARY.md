# Session Summary – WLILO Design Skills Agent

## What changed
- Added jsgui3-focused WLILO UI design guidance as a discoverable Skill.
- Added a WLILO design system Skill so “WLILO look” is repeatable via tokens + validation.
- Added an emoji Design Skills agent to curate design knowledge into Skills.

## Why it matters
- Makes WLILO attainable for any agent by reading a Skill (not by re-deriving taste).
- Keeps jsgui3 UI styling consistent and performance-conscious (token schema + control-count hygiene).

## Evidence
- See `WORKING_NOTES.md` for commands and outputs.

## Follow-ups
- Register the new agent in `.github/agents/index.json`.
