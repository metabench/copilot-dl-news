# Session Summary: scan-edit-remnants

## What changed
- Created the session plan + notes and linked the folder from `docs/sessions/SESSIONS_HUB.md` so future tooling work can reference this inventory.
- Ran Tier 1 discovery (`md-scan` to locate relevant sessions + `js-scan --what-imports` to confirm dependency scope) and logged both commands in `WORKING_NOTES.md`.
- Reviewed prior js-scan/js-edit sessions + backlog docs and captured outstanding improvements (TypeScript support phases, batch-plan schema/logging/rollback, Wave-2+ enhancements like fuzzy matching and cross-file atomic batches, and Gap 6 call-graph work).

## Next steps
- Prioritize the open items (Improvement 6 hotfix, TypeScript enablement, batch plan schema, Gap 6 analytics) and spin follow-up sessions for whichever workstream is tackled first.
