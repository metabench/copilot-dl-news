# Plan: scan-edit-remnants

**Objective**: Inventory the outstanding improvements for `js-scan` and `js-edit` noted in prior sessions and report what remains unfinished.

**Done when**
- [ ] Relevant session docs have been reviewed via required discovery tooling.
- [ ] Outstanding improvements/tasks are listed with source references.
- [ ] Any follow-up documentation needs are captured in session notes.

**Change set**
- docs/sessions/2025-11-16-scan-edit-remnants/WORKING_NOTES.md (context + command logs)
- docs/sessions/2025-11-16-scan-edit-remnants/SESSION_SUMMARY.md (final findings)

**Risks / Assumptions**
- Prior sessions accurately recorded open items; if conflicting notes appear, clarify in summary.
- No code changes expected; focus on documentation synthesis.

**Tests / Checks**
- None (read-only research task).

**Docs to update**
- docs/sessions/2025-11-16-scan-edit-remnants/WORKING_NOTES.md
- docs/sessions/2025-11-16-scan-edit-remnants/SESSION_SUMMARY.md
