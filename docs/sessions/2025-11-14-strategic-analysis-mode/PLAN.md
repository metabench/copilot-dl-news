# Plan – Strategic Analysis Mode

## Objective
Assess additional JS tooling improvements for agents

## Done When
- [ ] Discovery inventory of current JS tooling/documentation gaps captured in `WORKING_NOTES.md`.
- [ ] Actionable improvement proposals drafted (with owners/next steps) and copied into `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`.
- [ ] Follow-ups and doc update targets listed in `FOLLOW_UPS.md`.

## Change Set (initial sketch)
- `docs/sessions/2025-11-14-strategic-analysis-mode/PLAN.md` — working plan and completion checklist.
- `docs/sessions/2025-11-14-strategic-analysis-mode/WORKING_NOTES.md` — discovery notes and evidence.
- `docs/sessions/2025-11-14-strategic-analysis-mode/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` — final proposals + owners.
- `docs/sessions/2025-11-14-strategic-analysis-mode/FOLLOW_UPS.md` — backlog items (if new initiatives created).

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Spending too long reading every doc/code path. **Mitigation**: Limit discovery to top pain points surfaced via js-scan/doc review, stop after 3 primary opportunities.
- **Risk**: Recommendations too abstract to execute. **Mitigation**: Pair each proposal with concrete steps, affected files/tools, and test implications.
- **Risk**: Missing context from prior sessions. **Mitigation**: Skim recent session summaries and AGENT docs for overlapping efforts before proposing duplicates.

## Tests / Validation
- No automated tests required; validate by referencing existing files/commands that reveal the opportunity (document links or snippets in notes).
