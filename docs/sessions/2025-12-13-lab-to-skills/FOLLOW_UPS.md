# Follow Ups – Lab Experiments  Skills Consolidation

- Add a focused Skill for event delegation semantics (built on experiments 005–014) once those scenarios are routinely used for production decisions.
- Add a focused Skill for “activation + bundle freshness” that points to the smallest repro harness (SSR → bundle → activate) when available.
- Reconcile lab README vs manifest drift (e.g., if 015 streaming/virtual harness remains in manifest but not listed in README table).
- Add a lightweight “lab check runner” command or doc snippet that runs a selected set of checks by slug/id (without forcing full suite runs).
