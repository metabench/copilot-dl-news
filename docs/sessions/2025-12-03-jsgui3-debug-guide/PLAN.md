# Plan – Guide: jsgui3 debugging

## Objective
Document workflow and techniques for debugging jsgui3 controls/activation

## Done When
- [ ] Draft guide created (in docs/guides or docs/workflows) covering server/client activation debugging, controls instrumentation, and check scripts.
- [ ] Guidance aligns with AGENTS.md and UI Singularity workflow (servers `--check`/detached, js-scan/js-edit-first, check scripts).
- [ ] Session notes updated; summary and follow-ups captured.

## Change Set (initial sketch)
- `docs/guides/JSGUI3_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` (new)
- `docs/sessions/2025-12-03-jsgui3-debug-guide/*`

## Risks & Mitigations
- Guide bloat — keep concise, link out to existing architecture guide; include runnable snippets/check scripts.
- Missing patterns — borrow from recent WYSIWYG debugging work to ground steps.

## Tests / Validation
- No automated tests; validation is clarity and accuracy of the guide.
