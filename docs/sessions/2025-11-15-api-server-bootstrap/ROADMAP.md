# Roadmap

## Active
1. ✅ Audit dependencies required to run crawl job and background task routes.
2. ✅ Draft bootstrap plan for `startApiServer` that creates missing dependencies when not provided.
3. ✅ Implement wiring and ensure optional overrides remain supported.
4. Validate by running targeted smoke checks or route pings if feasible.

## Pending
- Capture additional documentation updates if new usage patterns emerge.
- Consider adding automated tests for the bootstrap logic.
