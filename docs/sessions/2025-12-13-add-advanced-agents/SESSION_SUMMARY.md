# Session Summary – Add advanced agent personas

## Outcome
Expanded the advanced agent ecosystem by adding five additional, highly-detailed “no handover” personas and registering them in the agent catalog.

## Added agents
- 🦉 Prof. Edge-Case 🦉 — edge-case repro + regression-guard specialist
- 🧰 Refactor Locksmith 🧰 — seam-first refactor specialist with contract tests
- 🕵️ Dependency Noir Detective 🕵️ — import/cycle/coupling investigator with actionable seams
- 🧪 Fixture Alchemist 🧪 — deterministic fixture pipeline (capture→minimize→redact→replay)
- 🗺️ UX Cartographer 🗺️ — UI flow mapping into diagrams, invariants, and checks

## Catalog updates
- Updated `.github/agents/index.json` to include these agents with slugs, purpose, tags, and paths.

## Validation evidence
- `.github/agents/index.json` parsing check (Node JSON parse) and `git status` confirmation are recorded in WORKING_NOTES.

## Accomplishments
- _Fill in key deliverables and outcomes._

## Metrics / Evidence
- _Link to tests, benchmarks, or telemetry supporting the results._

## Decisions
- _Reference entries inside `DECISIONS.md`._

## Next Steps
