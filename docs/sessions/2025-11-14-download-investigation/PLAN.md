# Plan: download-investigation

**Objective**: Determine why the Guardian crawl terminated after 51 downloads.

## Done When
- Run context and telemetry are summarized.
- Root cause of the early stop is identified with evidence.
- Recommendations for raising download counts are captured.

## Change Set
- Documentation only (this session folder, `docs/sessions/SESSIONS_HUB.md` if needed).

## Risks & Assumptions
- Assuming crawl defaults were used (`basicArticleDiscovery`).
- Investigative task only; no code changes planned unless a defect is confirmed.

## Verification
- Validate against collected crawl logs and CLI summary.
- Optionally re-run with modified options once recommendations are ready.

## Docs
- Update this session dir as findings emerge.
