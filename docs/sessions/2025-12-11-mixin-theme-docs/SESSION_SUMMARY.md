# Session Summary – Document mixin storage pattern

## Accomplishments
- Documented lab mixin storage pattern (push/each with `_store`) in lab README.
- Added agent guidance for custom mixins with server-safe storage wrapper example.
- Logged validation run for theme mixin check.

## Metrics / Evidence
- `node src/ui/lab/experiments/004-theme-mixin/check.js` → 4/4 passed.

## Decisions
- No separate ADR needed; guidance captured in agent + lab docs.

## Next Steps
- None pending; monitor future mixin experiments for additional patterns.
