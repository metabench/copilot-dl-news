# Follow-ups

- Consider adding a first-class “custom route” / “SSE publisher” hook to `jsgui3-server` so experiments can avoid running a second HTTP server.
- Consider adding a small MVVM utility to bind model keys directly to text nodes / attributes (reduce manual `textContent` render code).
- Optional hardening: implement an EventSource fallback (polling) for environments without `EventSource`.
