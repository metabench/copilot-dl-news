# Session Summary – Memory Feedback Badge Format

## Accomplishments
- Standardized the repo’s user-visible memory-load output to a continuation-friendly two-line format: `🧠 Memory pull (for this task) — ...` + `Back to the task: ...`.
- Added anti-spam rules so agents don’t repeat the badge unless something changed.
- Updated the key instruction surfaces (AGENTS + general guide + Design Skills agent + WLILO skills) to match.

## Metrics / Evidence
- See `WORKING_NOTES.md` for md-scan commands confirming the old badge is absent and the new badge is present.

## Decisions
- None.

## Next Steps
- Optionally update other agent persona files with the same badge rule if they introduce their own memory rituals.
