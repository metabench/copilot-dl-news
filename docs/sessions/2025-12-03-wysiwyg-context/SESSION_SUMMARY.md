# Session Summary – Inspect AGI agent system context

## Accomplishments
- Captured key guidance from `AGENTS.md` and UI/AGI Singularity agents (session-first, plan-first, server `--check`/detached patterns, js-scan/js-edit discipline, documentation expectations).
- Identified relevant AGI agent roles: meta-level Singularity Brain, AGI-Orchestrator planning/handoff rules, UI Singularity workflow for jsgui3 controls.
- Located the most recent WYSIWYG-related session `docs/sessions/2025-12-03-jsgui3-deep-research-singularity/` (plan created, work not yet started) and reviewed current WYSIWYG server/test surfaces.

## Metrics / Evidence
- No automated tests run; this session focused on context gathering.

## Decisions
- No new ADRs; context-only review.

## Next Steps
- Follow `FOLLOW_UPS.md` to continue the WYSIWYG demo/build work in the 2025-12-03 jsgui3 deep research session, adhering to UI Singularity workflow and server check/detached patterns.
