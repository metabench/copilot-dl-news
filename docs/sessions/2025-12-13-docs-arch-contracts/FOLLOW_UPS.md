# Follow Ups – Architectural Contracts Docs

- Optional: add contract tests for additional UI query modules (e.g. `domainListing.js`) so pagination + sorting invariants stay locked.
- Optional: update `docs/arch/CONTRACTS_DB_ACCESS.md` with a dedicated 503 mapping test if/when a standard DB-unavailable response helper is introduced.
