# Session Summary – Improve jsgui3 Workflow Access

## What Changed

- Added a workflow-first reminder + md-scan command snippet to `.github/instructions/GitHub Copilot.instructions.md`.
- Clarified the Dashboard Singularity agent’s Knowledge-First steps so every UI change starts with md-scan guided workflow discovery.
- Inserted a “Workflow Discovery Quickstart” section near the top of `docs/guides/JSGUI3_UI_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` describing how to locate relevant patterns and when to update the guide.

## Verification

- Manual review of updated docs to ensure new guidance appears in the right sections.

## Follow-Ups

- See `FOLLOW_UPS.md` (md-scan preset ideas).
