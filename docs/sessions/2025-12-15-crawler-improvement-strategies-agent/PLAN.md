# Plan: crawler-improvement-strategies-agent

Objective: Add a new emoji agent file focused on implementing `docs/designs/CRAWLER_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGIES.md` with strong session + docs-memory discipline.

Done when:
- The agent file exists and clearly defines the implementation loop (sense → slice → implement → verify → record → recommend next).
- The agent file includes an explicit docs-memory contract + required memory status badge.
- The agent is registered in `.github/agents/index.json`.

Change set:
- `.github/agents/🧭🕷️ Crawler Improvement Implementer 🧠.agent.md`
- `.github/agents/index.json`

Notes:
- This agent is meant to stay anchored to `docs/designs/CRAWLER_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGIES.md` and continuously propose “what next”.
