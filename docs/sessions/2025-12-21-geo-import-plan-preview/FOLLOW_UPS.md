# Follow Ups – Geo import plan preview UI

- Add Wikidata plan preview: list SPARQL endpoints, query templates, and expected request counts based on country filters + per-country steps.
- Add OSM plan preview: expected PBF/planet extracts, tiling steps, and DB targets (even if "coming soon").
- Add a quick toggle in the UI for `detail=fast` vs `detail=full` (line count can be slow on large files).
