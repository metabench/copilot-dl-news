# Plan: JS/TS Scan and Edit Tooling Improvements Brainstorm

Objective: Review existing js-scan and js-edit tools, analyze their capabilities and limitations, and brainstorm enhancements to enable better code editing for AI agents, potentially extending to TypeScript support.

Done when:
- Key tool files (js-scan.js, js-edit.js) and related docs reviewed
- Current capabilities documented in WORKING_NOTES.md
- Brainstorm ideas captured in session folder
- Session summary drafted with prioritized improvements

Change set: No code changes yet; analysis only

Risks/assumptions: Tools are JS-focused; extending to TS may require new dependencies or tools

Tests: Review existing tests for tools

Benchmark: N/A

Docs to update: AGENTS.md if new workflows identified; add to docs/sessions/SESSIONS_HUB.md
