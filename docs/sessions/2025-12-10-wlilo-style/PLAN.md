# Plan – WLILO aesthetic guidance

## Objective
Document WLILO style and propagation for agents

## Done When
- [ ] WLILO acronym and intent are documented for agents.
- [ ] Style guidance is captured in a dedicated doc and linked from AGENTS.md.
- [ ] Session summary and follow-ups are updated.

## Change Set (initial sketch)
- AGENTS.md (pointer to WLILO style doc)
- New WLILO style guide under docs/guides or docs/designs
- Session files: PLAN.md, WORKING_NOTES.md, SESSION_SUMMARY.md, FOLLOW_UPS.md

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Overloading AGENTS.md with detail — Mitigation: keep AGENTS.md brief, link out.
- Risk: Style doc too verbose — Mitigation: concise bullets with references to visuals.
- Risk: Missing existing artifacts — Mitigation: scan diagrams/screenshots for WLILO examples.

## Tests / Validation
- No automated tests; validate by ensuring links resolve and docs render in viewer.
