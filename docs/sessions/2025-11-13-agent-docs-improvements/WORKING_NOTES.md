# Working Notes

- 2025-11-13: Session created to review `.agent.md` inventory and identify improvement opportunities.
- 2025-11-13: Collected list of 12 `.agent.md` files; captured first-level headings to gauge intent drift.
- 2025-11-13: Spot check findings:
	- `Careful Builder.agent.md` repeats Jest guardrails section and still references `CHANGE_PLAN.md`, conflicting with new session protocol and testing rules.
	- `Upgrade js-md-scan-edit.agent.md` instructs agents to create `/docs/agents/js-tools/*` memory files instead of session folders.
	- Several docs (e.g., `Singularity Engineer.agent.md`, `Bilingual js tooling.agent.md`) predate Gap 5/6 features—need refresh to mention new CLI capabilities.
- 2025-11-13: Expanded `docs/sessions/SESSIONS_HUB.md` with tooling references (`COMMAND_EXECUTION_GUIDE`, `TESTING_QUICK_REFERENCE`, `AGENT_REFACTORING_PLAYBOOK`) and workflow pointers to help agents find deeper guidance.
