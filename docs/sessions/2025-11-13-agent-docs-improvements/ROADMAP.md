# Roadmap

## Objective
Audit all `.agent.md` files and propose concrete improvements that increase clarity, consistency, and operational alignment for agents working in this repository.

## Done When
- Inventory of existing `.agent.md` files with purpose and current status is documented.
- Gaps, redundancies, and outdated guidance are identified with supporting evidence.
- Actionable improvement plan (sequenced recommendations) is produced and recorded in Follow Ups / Summary.

## Task Board
- [x] Collect metadata for each `.agent.md` file (persona, scope, last update signals).
- [ ] Assess alignment with current tooling and workflows (Gap 2/3/6 references, session protocol compliance).
- [ ] Identify cross-document inconsistencies or missing coverage.
- [ ] Draft prioritized improvement recommendations (quick wins vs. deeper work).
- [ ] Update session docs (SUMMARY, FOLLOW_UPS, SEARCH_INDEX) with findings.

## Risks / Assumptions
- Assumes `.agent.md` files are authoritative for persona onboarding; conflicting instructions may exist elsewhere.
- Improvements focus on guidance quality rather than content rewrites during this analysis.

## Tests / Verification
- N/A (documentation analysis task).

## Docs to Update
- `docs/sessions/2025-11-13-agent-docs-improvements/*.md` as work progresses.
