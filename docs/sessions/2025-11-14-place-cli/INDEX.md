# Session 2025-11-14 — Place-Focused CLI Enablement

## Overview
- **Objective**: Make place discovery workflows accessible through `crawl.js`
- **Status**: In progress

## Scope
1. Hook GuessPlaceHubs orchestration into the shared crawl CLI for single-domain workflows.
2. Provide easy entry points for place-oriented explore operations with sensible defaults.
3. Document usage patterns and pending enhancements for future agents.

## Recent Context
- Basic crawl workflow adjusted to prioritize exploration first (guardian crawl defaults updated).
- CLI availability output now lists sequence presets for discovery.
- Agents requested convenient CLI entry points for place-centric operations.

## Pending Deliverables
- CLI command set for place workflows.
- Notes on any limitations or follow-up tasks discovered during implementation.
