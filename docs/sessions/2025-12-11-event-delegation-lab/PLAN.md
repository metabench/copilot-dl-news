# Plan – Event delegation lab

## Objective
Run 10 experiments on delegation and bubbling patterns

## Done When
- [ ] Ten delegation/bubbling experiments are scaffolded in `src/ui/lab/experiments/005-014-*` with README + check stubs.
- [ ] Lab README and `manifest.json` list the new experiments.
- [ ] Session notes capture design intentions; summary and follow-ups filled in.

## Change Set (initial sketch)
- src/ui/lab/experiments/005-014-* (new folders with README + check stubs)
- src/ui/lab/README.md
- src/ui/lab/manifest.json
- docs/sessions/2025-12-11-event-delegation-lab/WORKING_NOTES.md
- docs/sessions/2025-12-11-event-delegation-lab/SESSION_SUMMARY.md
- docs/sessions/2025-12-11-event-delegation-lab/FOLLOW_UPS.md

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Stub checks mislead status. Mitigation: mark experiments as proposed and log TODO in check scripts.
- Risk: Table/manifest drift. Mitigation: update both README and manifest together.

## Tests / Validation
- (Optional) Run select check stubs to confirm they execute without error.
