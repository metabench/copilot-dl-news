# Follow Ups – Event delegation lab

- Build real control-based harnesses (SSR + activation) mirroring the synthetic trees; rerun checks to validate parity.
- Add timing metrics to performance batch (014) across delegated vs per-node listeners; plot thresholds.
- Document selector matching pitfalls (text nodes) and dynamic child coverage in agent/guides.
- Summarize delegation/bubbling patterns into guides and agent knowledge map after data collection.
