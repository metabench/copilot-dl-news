# Plan – Gazetteer ingestion review

## Objective
Review gazetteer ingestion pipeline/tooling and document findings

## Done When
- [ ] Gazetteer ingestion pipeline/tooling reviewed end-to-end with notes in `WORKING_NOTES.md`.
- [ ] Findings synthesized into an SVG document in the session folder with a “Luxury Obsidian Industrial” style.
- [ ] Recommendations and follow-ups captured in `FOLLOW_UPS.md`; summary prepared in `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`.

## Change Set (initial sketch)
- docs/sessions/2025-11-30-gaz-ingest-review/WORKING_NOTES.md
- docs/sessions/2025-11-30-gaz-ingest-review/SESSION_SUMMARY.md
- docs/sessions/2025-11-30-gaz-ingest-review/FOLLOW_UPS.md
- docs/sessions/2025-11-30-gaz-ingest-review/gazetteer-ingestion-review.svg

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Missing historical context about prior ingestion changes; Mitigation: scan past session docs for gazetteer topics if needed.
- Risk: Overlooking non-obvious scripts or checks; Mitigation: search for “gazetteer” and “ingest” across repo and docs.
- Risk: Time spent on styling the SVG; Mitigation: keep structure clear and leverage minimal palette/layout.

## Tests / Validation
- No code changes expected; validate by citing key files/flows and ensuring SVG renders correctly (view locally if time).
