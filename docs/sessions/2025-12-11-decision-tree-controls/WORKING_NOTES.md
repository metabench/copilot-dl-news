# Working Notes – Polish decision tree controls UI

- 2025-12-11 — Session created via CLI. Add incremental notes here.
- 2025-12-11 — Ran `decisionTreeViewer.check.js` (all pass). Updated connection geometry to anchor beziers on explicit connection point controls (output-yes/output-no/input-top) in both `ConnectionRenderer` and legacy fallback; re-ran check script (still all pass, connections now follow connector centers).
