# Plan: Gazetteer Tooling

Objective: Create CLI tooling to navigate and find gazetteer data for human and AI use.

Done when:
- [x] `gazetteer-scan.js` is implemented.
- [x] `gazetteer.search.js` query module is implemented.
- [x] Documentation is created.
- [x] Tool is verified to work.

Change set:
- `src/tools/gazetteer-scan.js`
- `src/db/sqlite/v1/queries/gazetteer.search.js`
- `docs/tools/GAZETTEER_TOOLS.md`

Risks/assumptions:
- Assumed schema details (corrected during verification).

Tests:
- Manual verification via CLI commands.
