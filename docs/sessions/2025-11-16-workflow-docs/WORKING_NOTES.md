# Working Notes — 2025-11-16 Workflow Docs

## Discovery
- `docs/INDEX.md` currently lists only three workflow guides (doc extraction, planning/review loop, Kilo agent handbook).
- AGENTS.md + Singularity Engineer brief spell out session protocols and Tier 1 tooling expectations but lack standalone workflow docs.

## Decisions (in progress)
- Target workflows:
  1. **Session Bootstrap Workflow** — create/maintain session folders, plan, working notes, hub updates.
  2. **Tier 1 Tooling Loop** — js-scan discovery + js-edit dry-run/apply + document/test steps.

## Drafting Notes
- Authored `docs/workflows/session_bootstrap_workflow.md` covering naming, folder skeleton, hub updates, and closure steps.
- Authored `docs/workflows/tier1_tooling_loop.md` with phased checklist (discovery, plan, apply, verify) plus bilingual CLI guidance.

## Command Log
- N/A (documentation task only so far).

## Follow-ups
- After drafting, confirm whether additional workflows (e.g., binding plugin lifecycle) should be queued as future work.
