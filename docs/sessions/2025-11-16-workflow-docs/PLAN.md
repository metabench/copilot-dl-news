# Plan: workflow-docs

Objective: Create reusable workflow guides under `docs/workflows/` so other agents can follow the session setup + Tier 1 tooling patterns without rereading AGENTS.md each time.

Done when:
- Workflow topics are selected based on current documentation gaps and recent directives (session protocol + Tier 1 tooling)
- At least two new markdown guides exist in `docs/workflows/` with actionable steps and references
- `docs/INDEX.md` lists the new guides under the Workflows section
- Session folder captures working notes and summary per repo rules

Change set: `docs/workflows/session_bootstrap_workflow.md`, `docs/workflows/tier1_tooling_loop.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/sessions/2025-11-16-workflow-docs/*`

Risks/assumptions: Focus on documenting workflows rather than adding new code; ensure guidance aligns with AGENTS.md + Singularity Engineer instructions; avoid duplicating existing docs.

Tests: N/A (documentation)

Docs to update: New workflow files + `docs/INDEX.md` and this session folder.
