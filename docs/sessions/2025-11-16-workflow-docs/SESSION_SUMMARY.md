# Session Summary — 2025-11-16 Workflow Docs

_Status_: Complete

## Highlights
- Added two reusable workflow guides (`session_bootstrap_workflow.md`, `tier1_tooling_loop.md`) so agents can bootstrap sessions and run Tier 1 tooling without re-reading AGENTS.md each time.
- Logged commands/decisions in the session folder and linked the effort from `docs/sessions/SESSIONS_HUB.md` for discoverability.

## Outcomes
- New docs live under `docs/workflows/` and are indexed in `docs/INDEX.md`.
- Session records (plan, notes, summary) capture reasoning plus the drafting details for future reference.

## Next Steps
- Consider a follow-up workflow for binding plugin lifecycle once current UI efforts settle.
