# Decisions – Anthropic skill systems vs Copilot

| Date | Context | Decision | Consequences |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-12-13 | User asked whether Anthropic “Skills” can be used in Copilot here | Implement a “skills-like” abstraction via repo docs + MCP discovery, rather than depending on Claude Code’s filesystem features | Requires a new skills registry + MCP tool surface; optional UI can improve discovery/activation |
