# Follow Ups – Anthropic skill systems vs Copilot

- Owner: 💡Singularity Engineer💡 — Draft a minimal “Skill Pack” spec for this repo (folder layout + required fields + validation/evidence conventions).
- Owner: 🔧 CLI Tool Singularity 🔧 — Add docs-memory MCP support for “skills” (list/get/search/propose-improvement) with `onlyStats` + `hint` fields.
- Owner: 💡UI Singularity💡 — Design a jsgui3 “Skill Atlas” discovery page (list skills, show triggers, link checks/tests, keep control count lean).
- Owner: 🧪 AGI-QA-Tests — Propose a minimal test strategy for skill registry tools (schema validation, filtering behavior, hint presence).
- Owner: 🧠 AGI Brainstorm 🌩️🧠 — Seed 3–5 initial skills (telemetry, svg-collisions, jsgui3 activation, db schema sync, test runner) as docs-only stubs.
