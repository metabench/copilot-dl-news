# Root Migration Collection

**Purpose**: Preserve documentation that previously lived at the repository root before the 2025-11-16 cleanup. Everything here should eventually be consolidated into an existing docs subsection (agents, workflows, reports, etc.), but this directory keeps the content accessible while we categorize it.

## Files Relocated on 2025-11-16
- `ANALYSIS_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`
- `CHANGE_PLAN.md`
- `CHANGE_PLAN_JSEDIT_WITH_CODE.md`
- `CLI_REFACTORING_TASKS.md`
- `RESTRUCTURING_PROPOSAL.md`
- `SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-11-13.md`
- `TEST_RUNNER_UPDATE_COMPLETE.md`
- `TEST_RUNNER_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`
- `TOOLING_ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
- `TOOLS_DEPENDENCY_REPORT.md`
- `WORKFLOW_REVIEW_COMPLETE.md`

## Next Steps
- Categorize each file and move it into the appropriate docs subsection (e.g., `docs/reports/`, `docs/workflows/`, `docs/agents/archives/`).
- Update `docs/INDEX.md` (and other indexes) when files receive their permanent homes.
