# jsgui3 Lab

This directory is the **center for jsgui3 research and reusable code** in this project.

Goals:
- Host small, well-factored controls and utilities that demonstrate best-practice jsgui3 patterns.
- Provide ready-to-drop-in building blocks for dashboards, editors, and experiments.
- Serve as a staging area for ideas that might be promoted into the upstream jsgui3 stack.

Structure:
- `controls/` – Reusable controls (e.g., panels, toolbars) with minimal assumptions.
- `utils/` – Shared helpers for activation, layout, and DOM wiring.
- `checks/` – Node scripts that render controls/utilities in isolation.

See also:
- `docs/guides/JSGUI3_UI_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` – Canonical jsgui3 architecture guide.
- `docs/guides/ART_PLAYGROUND_AGENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` – Interactive SVG example built on jsgui3.
