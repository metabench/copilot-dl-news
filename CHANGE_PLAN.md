# CHANGE_PLAN.md ‚Äî AST Editing Tool Investigation

## Goal
- Assess and, if feasible, prototype a repository-friendly code transformation CLI that can safely extract and replace JavaScript functions in very large files without manual `apply_patch` edits.
- Determine whether adopting a high-performance parser (possibly via a native Node.js add-on) measurably improves turnaround time and correctness for bulk refactors.

## Current Behavior
- Contributors rely on editor tooling or `apply_patch` for code edits; no repo-provided automation exists for syntax-aware transformations.
- Existing CLI helpers (e.g., `tools/*`) focus on data operations and reporting, not AST manipulation.
- There is no dependency on Babel/Recast/Tree-sitter today; the toolchain avoids native build requirements beyond better-sqlite3.

## Proposed Changes (SWC Track)
1. **Add SWC Dependency** ‚Äî Introduce `@swc/core` to the workspace (document installation caveats for Windows/PowerShell) and capture any package-lock churn.
2. **Bootstrap `tools/dev/` Workspace** ‚Äî Create `tools/dev/` for experimental-yet-safe developer CLIs that still follow the shared parser/formatter conventions; add README stub.
3. **Design `js-edit` CLI Skeleton** ‚Äî Draft `tools/dev/js-edit.js` using `CliArgumentParser`/`CliFormatter`, enforcing dry-run by default and supporting basic commands (`--list-functions`, `--extract <name>`, `--replace <name> --with <file>`).
4. **Implement SWC AST Helpers** ‚Äî Build a small helper module (e.g., `tools/dev/lib/swcAst.js`) that wraps `@swc/core` parse/print APIs, preserving formatting via SWC‚Äôs code generator and ensuring comments survive round-trips.
5. **Validation Harness** ‚Äî Add focused tests/fixtures under `tests/tools/__tests__/` to verify extraction/replacement on representative large-file samples and ensure dry-run leaves files unchanged.
6. **Performance Benchmarks** ‚Äî Measure SWC parse + transform time on a large file (>1k LOC) using CLI `--benchmark` flag; record results in docs for future comparison.
7. **Operator UX & Safety** ‚Äî Provide diff preview (`--emit-diff`) support and clear messaging about dry-run vs. `--fix`; document fallback guidance if SWC compilation fails on a machine.

## Detailed Roadmap: js-edit Locator & Guardrail Enhancements

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Discovery & Requirements (Day 0‚Äì1)
1. **Baseline CLI Audit**
	- Enumerate current commands (`--list-functions`, `--extract`, `--replace`) and their outputs.
	- Capture limitations: shared names, lack of class scoping, no structural selectors, single-span validation only.
2. **Use-Case Inventory**
	- Interview task logs to identify recurring edit patterns: replace class method, rename export, patch nested helper.
	- Produce two representative fixtures: one with heavily nested classes/methods, one with mixed named exports and factory functions.
3. **Parser Capability Check**
	- Verify SWC node shapes for `ClassMethod`, `ClassProperty`, and `TS` nodes (even if TypeScript optional) to ensure future-proofing.
	- Note span behavior (start/end, leading keywords) to inform guardrail calculations.

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Enhanced Node Indexing (Day 2)
1. **Scoped Naming**
	- Extend `collectFunctions` to build canonical labels: `alpha`, `MyClass#render`, `MyClass.static initialize`, `exports.default`, etc.
	- Attach `scopeChain` array (e.g., `['MyClass', '#render']`) for downstream selectors.
2. **Deterministic Path Signatures**
	- During traversal, accumulate a `nodePath` string that mirrors visitation order (`module.body[4].class.body[2].method`). Store on each record.
	- Expose helper to render friendly selectors (CSS-like) and machine selectors (array of indices).
3. **Token Hashing**
	- For each record, slice the raw source span and compute a stable hash (e.g., SHA-256). Persist on the record for guardrail comparison.

### Phase 3 ‚Äî CLI Surface Expansion (Day 3)
1. **Introduce `--locate` Command**
	- Usage: `js-edit --file foo.js --locate alpha`.
	- Output: table/JSON containing `name`, `kind`, `scope`, `line:column`, `startOffset`, `endOffset`, `pathSignature`, `hash`, `replaceable`.
	- For ambiguous matches (>1), exit non-zero unless `--select` (see below) is provided.
2. **Support Qualified Queries**
	- Accept patterns `ClassName#method`, `ClassName.method`, `ClassName::method` (alias) and exact `pathSignature` via `--path`.
	- Implement argument normalization so `--extract`/`--replace` reuse the same resolution logic.
3. **Selection Flags**
	- Add `--select <index>` to pick nth match when duplicates remain (index order defined by source span).
	- Offer `--allow-multiple` (default off) to opt out of the uniqueness guard when intentionally targeting multiple matches.

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Guardrails & Verification (Day 4)
1. **Dual Verification**
	- During replacement, require both span match AND hash match (unless `--force` supplied).
	- Surface a CLI flag (e.g., `--expect-hash`) that agents can populate from a prior `--locate` run so drifted files fail fast.
	- After splicing, re-parse (already implemented) and ensure newly generated hash differs; log diff preview if unchanged.
2. **Selector Confirmation**
	- If `--path` provided, recompute path signature on fresh AST post-parse and confirm the targeted node still resolves there.
3. **Dry-Run Diagnostics**
	- Extend dry-run output with explicit guardrail summary: `Span OK`, `Hash OK`, `Path OK`, `Syntax OK`.
4. **Error Messaging**
	- Provide actionable failure reasons (e.g., ‚ÄúHash mismatch: file changed since locate step. Re-run --locate and retry.‚Äù).

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Token-Level Edits (Day 5)
1. **Sub-span Targeting**
	- ‚úÖ Introduced `--replace-range start:end` for targeted edits (offsets relative to the located function) with bounds validation.
2. **Inline Mutation Helpers**
	- ‚úÖ Added `--rename <newName>` convenience for renaming function identifiers when the declaration exposes a named identifier; limited to declaration renames for safety.
3. **JSON Patch Export**
  	- ‚úÖ Implemented ‚Äî `--emit-plan` now writes guard metadata (path signature, offsets, hash) for locate/extract/replace flows alongside CLI JSON payloads. Covered by integration tests.

### Phase 6 ‚Äî Documentation & Examples (Day 6)
1. **Update `tools/dev/README.md`**
	- Add usage examples for `--locate`, qualified names, guardrail outputs, and ambiguity resolution.
2. **Add HOWTO Section**
	- Extend `docs/CLI_REFACTORING_QUICK_START.md` (or create referenced section) describing AST edits with js-edit, focusing on guardrail workflows.
3. **Workflow Recipes**
	- Document two sample flows: replacing a class method, renaming a default export. Include command sequence and expected output.

### Phase 7 ‚Äî Testing & Validation (Day 7)
1. **Unit Tests**
	- Expand fixtures to include nested classes, overloaded method names, getters/setters.
	- Verify `collectFunctions` outputs scope chains, path signatures, and hashes correctly.
2. **CLI Integration Tests**
	- Use `child_process` to invoke `js-edit` with `--locate`, `--select`, `--replace` (dry-run). Assert JSON outputs and guardrail statuses.
3. **Regression Matrix**
	- Ensure guardrails prevent edits when file drifts, when replacement introduces syntax errors, and when selector mismatch occurs.

### Phase 8 ‚Äî Performance Review (Day 8)
1. **Benchmark Variants**
	- Measure locate/replace performance on small (200 LOC), medium (1k LOC), large (5k LOC) files.
	- Compare runtime with and without optional reference checks (hash vs. path) to confirm overhead is acceptable.
2. **Optimization Opportunities**
	- If needed, memoize `pathSignature` computation per traversal; still no cross-invocation caching.
	- Confirm the CLI remains responsive (<500ms) for locate operations on medium files.

### Phase 9 ‚Äî Rollout & Follow-Up (Day 9)
1. **Release Checklist**
	- Ensure CHANGELOG/docs updated, example commands verified, tests green.
2. **Feedback Loop**
	- Encourage early adopters to report edge cases; instrument CLI with optional `--debug` flag to log resolution details.
3. **Future Enhancements (Backlog)**
	- Explore AST query language integration (e.g., tsquery-like selectors).
	- Consider multi-edit batches (`--script plan.json`) once guardrails prove reliable.

> üìå *Caching the AST between operations is intentionally deferred per operator guidance; all steps above assume fresh parsing per invocation.*

## Risks & Unknowns
- **Native Build Toolchain** ‚Äî `@swc/core` ships prebuilt binaries, but PowerShell installs still require build tools fallback; document remediation if npm falls back to source builds.
- **Formatting Drift** ‚Äî SWC‚Äôs code generator may reformat output; mitigate by isolating edits to targeted spans and optionally piping through prettier when needed.
- **Scope Creep** ‚Äî Tool could become overly complex (multi-language, deep refactors) without clear guardrails.
- **Dependency Footprint** ‚Äî Introducing SWC increases install size; ensure CI caches node_modules or note install time expectations.

## Integration Points
- `tools/` CLI conventions (`CliArgumentParser`, `CliFormatter`, dry-run defaults).
- Potential reuse of existing diff/report helpers for preview output.
- Tests executed via `npx jest --runTestsByPath` with custom fixtures.
- Documentation sync with `docs/CLI_REFACTORING_QUICK_START.md` and `.github/instructions` if guidelines change.

## Docs Impact
- Update `docs/CLI_REFACTORING_QUICK_START.md` with syntax-aware tooling guidance.
- Add a new HOWTO section (likely in `docs/tools/` or an existing CLI reference) describing usage, safety flags, and known limitations.
- If guidelines change, adjust `.github/instructions/GitHub Copilot.instructions.md` accordingly.
- Detailed execution steps now tracked in `docs/JS_EDIT_ENHANCEMENTS_PLAN.md`; keep both documents in sync as phases progress.

## Focused Test Plan
- Unit tests hitting representative JS fixtures (default exports, named exports, nested functions) verifying extraction/replacement accuracy and dry-run behavior.
- Smoke test that a no-op run leaves files untouched.
- CLI integration tests covering error cases (missing function, parse failure, write without `--fix`).
- Optional benchmark script comparing parse times across parser choices (document results, not necessarily automated).
- ‚úÖ Ran `npx jest --config jest.careful.config.js --runTestsByPath tests/tools/__tests__/js-edit.test.js --bail=1` to cover plan emission, range replacements, and rename flows.

## Rollback Plan
- Tool is additive; reverting entails removing the new CLI, dependencies, and docs.
- Ensure package-lock.json updates can be undone via `git restore` if parser selection proves problematic.
