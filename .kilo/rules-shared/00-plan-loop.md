# Plan → Improve → Document Reminder

- Start each request by opening `AGENTS.md` and `docs/INDEX.md`, then drafting a plan (≤1 screen) inside the active session folder.
- Work in short, reversible commits: inspect callers before editing, prefer helper extraction, and never mix unrelated refactors.
- Document the change immediately: update JSDoc, add tests, refresh AGENTS/index references, and capture What changed? notes in the PR or session summary.
