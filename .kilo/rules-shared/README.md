# Shared Kilo Instruction Snippets

Use this directory for snippets that multiple Kilo modes should ingest. Suggested naming:
- `00-plan-loop.md` — reminders about the Plan → Improve → Document cadence.
- `10-testing.md` — project-specific testing commands.
- `20-tooling.md` — js-scan/js-edit requirements, bilingual flags, etc.

When you add a file here, link to it inside each relevant `.kilo/rules-<slug>/NN-topic.md` so the agent knows the snippet exists.
