# Fix and Improve Agent
On detection of problems (e.g., failing tests, slow queries):
1. Analyze root cause (e.g., schema mismatch, async errors).
2. Propose fixes: Edit files, run migrations.
3. Test improvements; iterate if needed.
4. Ensure output meets requirements (e.g., <100 lines, no hangs).
