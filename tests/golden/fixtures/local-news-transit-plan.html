            <p>The city council voted 7-2 on Thursday to approve a comprehensive new public transit plan that will transform how residents move around the metropolitan area. The $2.5 billion plan includes new bus rapid transit lines, expanded rail service, and improved pedestrian infrastructure.</p>
            
            <p>Mayor Robert Thompson hailed the vote as a "historic moment" for the city. "This plan will reduce traffic congestion, lower emissions, and make our city more accessible for everyone," he said following the vote.</p>
            
            <p>The plan, which has been in development for over three years, calls for the construction of four new bus rapid transit corridors connecting underserved neighborhoods to major employment centers. Additionally, the existing light rail system will be extended by 15 miles, adding eight new stations.</p>
            
            <p>Not everyone is happy with the decision. Council members who voted against the plan cited concerns about the cost and the proposed funding mechanism, which includes a small increase in the local sales tax.</p>
            
            <p>"While I support the goals of this plan, I have serious reservations about asking residents to pay more during these challenging economic times," said Councilwoman Patricia Williams, who voted against the measure.</p>
            
            <p>Supporters argue that the economic benefits of improved transit will far outweigh the costs. Studies commissioned by the transit authority estimate that the plan will generate $4 billion in economic activity and create over 20,000 jobs during the construction phase.</p>
            
            <p>Construction on the first phase of the project is expected to begin in spring 2026, with full completion anticipated by 2032. The transit authority will hold public meetings throughout the year to gather community input on specific route alignments and station locations.</p>
