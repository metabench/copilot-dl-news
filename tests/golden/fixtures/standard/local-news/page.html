      <h1>Council Gives Green Light to Riverside Park Expansion</h1>
      
      <p class="byline">By Tom Wilson, Staff Writer | Dec 18, 2025</p>
      
      <p>SMALLTOWN - The city council voted 5-2 Tuesday night to approve a $2.3 million expansion of Riverside Park, marking the largest parks investment in the city's history.</p>
      
      <p>The project will add a new playground, walking trails, and a community garden to the popular park on the west side of town.</p>
      
      <p>"This is a great day for our community," said Mayor Sarah Johnson after the vote. "Families have been asking for improved park facilities for years."</p>
      
      <p>Construction is expected to begin in March and be completed by fall. The project will be funded through a combination of city bonds and a state recreation grant.</p>
      
      <p>Councilmember Bob Davis and Helen Chen voted against the measure, citing concerns about the impact on traffic in the surrounding neighborhood.</p>
      
      <p>The expansion will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New playground with accessible equipment</li>
        <li>1.5 miles of paved walking trails</li>
        <li>Community garden with 40 plots</li>
        <li>Improved parking with 50 additional spaces</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Residents can view the complete project plans at City Hall or on the city website.</p>
