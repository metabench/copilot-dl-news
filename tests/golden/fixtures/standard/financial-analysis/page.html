      <p class="drop-cap">The Federal Reserve's announcement this week of a more aggressive rate-cutting trajectory has sent ripples through global financial markets. The central bank signaled three rate cuts in 2026, up from the two previously projected, marking a significant shift in the outlook for monetary policy.</p>
      
      <h2>Implications for Equities</h2>
      <p>Lower interest rates typically boost equity valuations by reducing the discount rate applied to future earnings. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 2.3% following the announcement, with technology stocks leading the rally.</p>
      
      <p>However, investors should be cautious about extrapolating this initial enthusiasm. Much depends on whether rate cuts are driven by controlled disinflation (positive for stocks) or deteriorating economic conditions (negative).</p>
      
      <h2>Bond Market Dynamics</h2>
      <p>Treasury yields fell sharply, with the 10-year yield dropping 15 basis points to 4.2%. This creates attractive opportunities for fixed-income investors, but also suggests the market is pricing in slower growth ahead.</p>
      
      <h2>Currency Considerations</h2>
      <p>The dollar weakened against major currencies, with the euro rising to $1.12. Emerging market currencies also benefited from the shift toward easier US monetary policy.</p>
      
      <blockquote class="pullquote">
        <p>"This is the clearest signal yet that the Fed believes it has inflation under control"</p>
        <cite>Janet Morrison, Goldman Sachs</cite>
      </blockquote>
      
      <h2>What Investors Should Watch</h2>
      <p>Key metrics to monitor in coming months include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Core PCE inflation readings</li>
        <li>Labor market indicators</li>
        <li>Consumer spending patterns</li>
        <li>Corporate earnings guidance</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The path ahead remains uncertain, but this week's Fed announcement represents a meaningful inflection point for market participants to recalibrate their portfolios.</p>
