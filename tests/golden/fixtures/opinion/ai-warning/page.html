      <p class="lead"><em>Dr. Amanda Collins is a professor of computer science at Stanford University and former technical advisor to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The views expressed here are her own.</em></p>
      
      <p>Last month, I watched an AI system solve a complex mathematical proof that had stumped researchers for decades. The breakthrough took the system just 47 minutes. It took humans 50 years to even formulate the problem correctly.</p>
      
      <p>This should give us all pause.</p>
      
      <p>I have spent my career at the forefront of artificial intelligence research. I have witnessed the field's evolution from simple rule-based systems to the sophisticated neural networks that now power everything from our phones to our cars. And I am worried.</p>
      
      <p>Not because I believe AI will become conscious and turn against us — the sci-fi scenario that dominates popular imagination. I am worried because our institutions, our legal frameworks, and our social structures are fundamentally unprepared for the changes that are already underway.</p>
      
      <h2>The Displacement Problem</h2>
      
      <p>Consider the labor market. Within the next five years, AI systems will be capable of performing most cognitive tasks currently done by white-collar workers. Not all of them, but enough to cause massive disruption. We have no plan for this.</p>
      
      <p>Previous technological revolutions played out over generations, giving society time to adapt. The AI revolution is happening in years, not decades. The jobs that disappear will not be replaced at anything close to the same rate.</p>
      
      <h2>What We Must Do</h2>
      
      <p>I propose three urgent actions:</p>
      
      <p><strong>First</strong>, we need a massive investment in education and retraining. Not the modest programs we have now, but a Marshall Plan for the AI age.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Second</strong>, we must begin serious discussions about universal basic income or similar safety net expansions. The old social contract is breaking.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Third</strong>, we need international cooperation on AI governance. No single nation can address these challenges alone.</p>
      
      <p>The future is not predetermined. But the window for shaping it responsibly is closing fast. We ignore these warnings at our peril.</p>
