    <div class="article-body interview-body">
      <p class="intro">Maria Chen has spent two decades at the forefront of the technology industry. As CEO of Nexus Corp, she oversees one of the world's most influential AI research labs. We spoke with her about the challenges and opportunities ahead.</p>
      
      <div class="qa-block">
        <p class="question"><strong>TechTalk:</strong> Your company recently announced a major breakthrough in AI reasoning. What makes this different from previous advances?</p>
        
        <p class="answer"><strong>Maria Chen:</strong> What we've achieved is a fundamental shift in how AI systems approach complex problems. Previous models were essentially very sophisticated pattern matchers. Our new architecture can actually decompose problems, test hypotheses, and revise its approach based on results. It's closer to how humans reason.</p>

      <div class="qa-block">
        <p class="question"><strong>TechTalk:</strong> Critics have raised concerns about AI safety. How do you respond?</p>
        
        <p class="answer"><strong>Maria Chen:</strong> Those concerns are valid and we take them extremely seriously. We've invested over $200 million in safety research. Every model we develop goes through extensive testing before deployment. But I also think we need to balance caution with progress. The benefits of AI — in healthcare, climate research, education — are enormous.</p>

      <div class="qa-block">
        <p class="question"><strong>TechTalk:</strong> Where do you see AI in ten years?</p>
        
        <p class="answer"><strong>Maria Chen:</strong> I expect AI to be deeply integrated into every aspect of our lives — but ideally in ways that are empowering rather than replacing. The best future is one where AI amplifies human capabilities. We should be using these tools to solve problems we couldn't tackle before, not just to automate what we already do.</p>

      <div class="qa-block">
        <p class="question"><strong>TechTalk:</strong> What advice would you give to young people entering the tech industry?</p>
        
        <p class="answer"><strong>Maria Chen:</strong> Don't just focus on the technology — understand the human context. The most impactful technologists are those who deeply understand the problems they're trying to solve. And never stop learning. This field changes faster than any other.</p>
