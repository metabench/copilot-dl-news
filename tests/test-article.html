                <p>The Trump administration has opened an inquiry into several universities over their handling of scholarships for undocumented immigrants under the Daca program.</p>

                <p>Officials from the Department of Education announced the investigation yesterday, citing concerns about how taxpayer money is being used to fund programs that benefit individuals who entered the country illegally.</p>

                <p>The universities named in the inquiry include Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, all of which have significant Daca student populations. University officials have expressed concern that the investigation could lead to cuts in federal funding.</p>

                <h2>Background on Daca</h2>

                <p>The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, created in 2012, allows certain undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children to remain in the country and obtain work permits.</p>

                <p>Critics of the program argue that it rewards illegal immigration and takes opportunities away from American citizens. Supporters say it provides stability for young people who had no say in their parents' decision to immigrate.</p>

                <p>The inquiry is expected to take several months, with hearings scheduled for next quarter. Universities are required to provide detailed documentation of their Daca scholarship programs.</p>
